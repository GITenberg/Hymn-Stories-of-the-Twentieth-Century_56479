<h2 class="center">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The most important musical feature of any service of
worship is the singing of hymns by the congregation.
When voices are united in Christian song, hearts may
readily be joined in common worship. Then it becomes
much more than a musical feature. It becomes an act of
worship. And all who thus sing are builders of a Temple
of Tone wherein their own hearts become the altar, high
and lifted up.</p>
<p>Before this great thing can come to pass, there must be
a familiarity with the hymns&mdash;an appreciation of these
&ldquo;crown jewels of the church.&rdquo; Anyone, then, who directs
attention to Christian hymns and stimulates interest in
them is adding to our resources for private and public
worship.</p>
<p>The author of this volume is continuing and extending
his Christian ministry by calling attention to the use of
hymns and gospel songs on various occasions and exhorting
us all to sing. He is a retired member of the Northern
New York Conference of The Methodist Church, honored
for his long and fruitful ministry, and beloved for his
unfailing devotion to the spreading of the gospel through
the still wider use of Christian hymns.</p>

<h2 class="center" id="c1"><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That was heavenly,&rdquo; said a Welshman at the close of
a service of sacred song at which he had listened to the
narration of incidents with apparent delight and had
joyously joined in the singing. Hymns are a source of joy
to persons of all ages; and youth and age alike enjoy singing
them. The hymnal stands next to the Bible in the devotional
reading of many people. Workers among young
people find hymn stories to be an important feature of
their work; and preachers know that an illustration relating
to a hymn not only makes an effective appeal but is
also long remembered. Short hymn stories give comforting
satisfaction to sick people in their quiet chambers,
especially when they can sometimes sing or hum them.</p>
<p>Great hymns belong to the ages. They are timeless, and
always new stories are being associated with them. But
this collection of stories does not range over the centuries;
it comes from our own century almost entirely. The hymns
are mostly old; but the stories are new. Two quotations
indicate what a hymn is and its effects.</p>
<p>The following was adopted by The Hymn Society of
America as its definition of a Christian hymn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Christian hymn is a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally
conceived, which is designed to be sung and
which expresses the worshipper&rsquo;s attitude toward God, or
God&rsquo;s purposes in human life. It should be simple and
metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary
in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and
so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while
singing it.&rdquo;&mdash;Carl F. Price.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some kinds of music are like mental and spiritual food.
They console us when we have lost someone dear to us.
They inspire us to higher forms of living, which give us
greater inner satisfaction. They stimulate us to make
greater effort to overcome the immense difficulties in the
future. This kind of music is beyond question of great
value to every individual, community, and nation. This
kind of music was bequeathed to us from many lands and
is the birthright of everyone.&rdquo;&mdash;Leopold Stokowski in
&ldquo;The New York Times Magazine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hymn stories are related to a definite moment and to
an unusual experience, such as the one which tells of the
men in the submarine (<a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>); or that which relates how
the visiting Scotsman thrilled the Presbyterian ministers in
Philadelphia, and their kindled emotions found expression
in a hymn (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>). Many of them came spontaneously
from the heart, and thus they make a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Such incidents as these, coming from several lands, the
author has gleaned from many sources, both American
and British, and now he shares them with his readers.
The sources from whence they came have been indicated,
and his gratitude for the privilege of passing them on to
others is very great.</p>
<p>The index will enable the reader to find the hymns
included. The hymns themselves come from standard
hymnals of the churches. A short bibliography is included.
Among the books mentioned, that of Dr. Moffatt is especially
useful, because it partakes, somewhat, of the nature
of a short dictionary of hymnology. Professor Smith&rsquo;s
work is unique in its arrangements and will be particularly
helpful to those preparing programs for special occasions.
A copy of the handbook to the hymnal which the reader
uses will prove to be very valuable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The author gratefully acknowledges the helpful service
rendered by the Rev. Herbert Harrison.</p>
<p>Readers will peruse with deep interest the Foreword
written by Bishop W. Earl Ledden. His life has been intimately
related to church music. During his student days
in both college and theological seminary, he was actively
associated with musical leadership. Since his election to
the episcopacy, he has sometimes given addresses to group
meetings of ministers and church lay leaders on the importance
of appropriate music in church services. His
words, therefore, come from the pen of one who has had
ripe experience in the field of hymnology.</p>

<h3 id="c3">They Sang with the Marine Band</h3>
<p>The community Christmas Tree at Washington in 1946
afforded a pleasant occasion when it was illuminated. The
scene was outlined for, probably, millions of listeners in all
parts of the country. The nation was enjoying an unusually
happy season, for though World War II had
ended more than a year before, many of the nation&rsquo;s sons
and daughters who had taken a part in the terrific struggle
had only recently returned to their homes. Wartime restrictions
had made a tree impossible for a few years;
and so this lighting of the tree at the capital was an enjoyable
feature, and Washington, apparently, made the
most of it. The evening was fair. The crowds were in
attendance, and President Truman delivered an address.</p>
<p>The United States Marine Band played, of course, and
the school children, in festive mood, sang, as well as
others. The tree was ablaze with lights.</p>
<p>The ceremonies were announced to close with the playing
of &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; by the band, and the
musicians began to play. Soon there came over the radio
the humming of many voices, then the people began to
sing as the band played. Gradually the volume of voices
increased. And before the music ceased it sounded as
though a mighty chorus expressed their pent-up feelings
in the happy strains:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, say! does that star-spangled banner still wave</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er the land of the free and the home of the brave?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The joy of freedom was in their hearts and voices at
that happy and memorable moment. Band and voices
made mighty and glorious music for the many who sat in
their homes and listened to the convenient radio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3 id="c4">Song of the Chaplain&rsquo;s Wife</h3>
<p>She was lonesome as she sat in the small parsonage.
Her preacher husband had entered the army as a chaplain
in World War II, and this little woman, like many others
of that period, had several problems to solve. A family
of small children had to be looked after. Furthermore,
being a lay preacher, she had been asked to care for her
husband&rsquo;s church during the period of his service with the
armed forces of the United States. Household help was
almost impossible to secure; but, with the aid of a high
school girl, mostly, she cared for the home, with its three
small children, and also the church.</p>
<p>This little woman (for she was really small physically)
was a trained musician. She could both play and sing, if
need be, as well as preach. Natural was it, therefore, that
she should turn to her hymnal as well as her Bible for
needed strength of soul. She found it in a comparatively
new hymn. Its prayerful spirit expressed the yearning desire
of her soul:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come! Peace of God, and dwell again on earth,</p>
<p class="t0">Come, with the calm that hailed Thy Prince&rsquo;s birth,</p>
<p class="t0">Come, with the healing of Thy gentle touch,</p>
<p class="t0">Come, Peace of God, that this world needs so much.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She asked to have it sung when I led a devotional service.
Then I later wrote her, asking: &ldquo;What particular
association has this hymn with your life?&rdquo; Her answer
was as follows: &ldquo;It is a favorite hymn with me, partly
because of the unusual and beautiful harmony to be found
in the music, and partly because the words are my own
prayer for the world, and also for myself, now that my
husband is serving as a chaplain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Seeking information concerning the hymn itself, I
turned to the informing work of Dr. McCutchen. There
I learned that it &ldquo;was written about 1928, when there
was much talk about the peace of the world and a great
desire for it amid the unrest of the nations.&rdquo; The author,
Miss May Rowland, submitted it in manuscript to the
commission preparing the new hymnal of The Methodist
Church, &ldquo;and its inclusion in this book (1935) marked
its first publication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of the hymn, and also the composer of the
tune (&ldquo;Pax&rdquo;), are both residents of England, and each
is a prize-winner. When The Hymn Society of America
issued an appeal for a &ldquo;Hymn for Airmen,&rdquo; though
there were more than twelve hundred competitors from
all parts of the world, Miss Rowland won. Musicians were
then invited to furnish a musical setting for the same.
This contest was also world-wide, and Miss Lily Rendle
was the winner. This was in 1928; and both women were
greatly surprised to learn that they each lived in Bournemouth
within a mile of each other, though they were born
in different parts of the country. &ldquo;Since that time their
artistic association has been close.&rdquo; One of their beautiful
joint productions is this:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The day is slowly wending</p>
<p class="t0">Toward its silent ending,</p>
<p class="t0">But &rsquo;mid its light declining</p>
<p class="t0">The evening star is shining:</p>
<p class="t">O Father, while we sleep,</p>
<p class="t2">Thy children keep!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>World War II ended suddenly and dramatically. Soldiers
were returning home in large numbers by the latter part
of 1945. &ldquo;Will Daddy be home for Christmas?&rdquo; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
chaplain&rsquo;s children began to ask. &ldquo;We hope so,&rdquo; was the
cheery reply of the anticipating woman. &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll
even return for Thanksgiving,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>One day early in November Chaplain Donald M. Cobb,
of the United States Army, appeared at the parsonage in
the little railroad center at Richland, New York. What an
unspeakably happy moment for him, his wife, and the
three growing children! Thanksgiving and Christmas
would both be spent at home. Now a manly voice could
blend with the voices of his wife and the growing girls,
as that night the family circle gathered around the piano
and sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come! Blessed Peace, as when, in hush of eve,</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s benediction falls on souls who grieve;</p>
<p class="t0">As shines a star when weary day departs,</p>
<p class="t0">Come! Peace of God, and rule within our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c5">Our Popular Processional Hymn</h3>
<p>The annual picnic in many of our American Sunday
Schools has some features in common with the annual tea
treat in the program of the village Sunday Schools in
England. The latter, however, has some more spectacular
features, such as the procession through the village streets
headed, most likely, by a band as well as the minister and
the superintendent. Whit-Monday is a favored time in
many sections of the country for this eagerly anticipated
event.</p>
<p>For such a day as this a young curate in Horbury, a
Yorkshire village, was asked to select a hymn to be sung
for the Whit-Monday occasion. He thought of a good
marching tune, but he did not like the words. So he sat
up late one night, composed his own song, and it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
sung the next day for the first time. That was in 1864;
and it was published in <i>The Church Times</i> (October 15)
that same year as a &ldquo;Hymn for Procession with Cross and
Banners&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Onward, Christian soldiers!</p>
<p class="t">Marching as to war,</p>
<p class="t0">With the cross of Jesus</p>
<p class="t">Going on before.</p>
<p class="t0">Christ, the royal Master,</p>
<p class="t">Leads against the foe;</p>
<p class="t0">Forward into battle,</p>
<p class="t">See His banners go!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn rates high both in the United States and in
England. St. Gertrude is ideally associated with the song.
This tune came from Sir Arthur Sullivan; but someone has
sagely remarked, &ldquo;It took Baring-Gould to inspire Sir
Arthur.&rdquo; &ldquo;As a hymn of inspiration it has no superior,&rdquo;
said Dr. E. S. Lorenz. More than half a century ago Dr.
Charles S. Robinson made this illuminating comment:
&ldquo;It meets an American ideal, mechanically speaking, in
that it is simple, rhythmical, lyric, and has a refrain at
the end of each stanza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little folks like to sing this song whenever they
have the opportunity, and this is one of the hymns they
often learn before they can read. &ldquo;It is fundamentally a
Sunday School song; but it has grown up and is now
sung many more times in the congregation than in the
Sunday school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloriously inspiring is it to hear a great company of
people of all ages sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Crown and thrones may perish,</p>
<p class="t">Kingdoms rise and wane,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p class="t0">But the Church of Jesus</p>
<p class="t">Constant will remain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Sabine Baring-Gould, the author (1834-1924) a graduate
of Cambridge University, was a man of unusual
versatility. Some of his experiences were exceptional. He
had means at his disposal, and spent considerable time in
his youth in France and Germany. Writing extensively,
&ldquo;it is said that he has more book titles listed in the
literary catalogue of the British Museum than any other
writer of his times.&rdquo; Various parishes were served by him
until 1881. He then exercised his rights &ldquo;as squire of the
estate in Lew Trenchard, Devon,&rdquo; which he inherited from
his father, and appointed himself as rector.</p>
<p>This historic incident has been preserved for us by Dr.
E. S. Lorenz: &ldquo;It had been carefully arranged by the
Executive Committee of the World&rsquo;s Sunday School Convention,
held at Washington, D. C., in 1910, that the
hymn &lsquo;Onward, Christian Soldiers,&rsquo; should be sung in
Sunday Schools in every part of the world on Sunday,
May 22, of that year. For this purpose the hymn was
translated and printed in more than one hundred languages
and dialects. What a magnificent illustration of
the solidarity of the Christian Church in a progressive,
aggressive attitude!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c6">Heard Lauder&rsquo;s Song and Wesley&rsquo;s Hymn</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Before going to our watch-night services many of us
heard Sir Harry Lauder singing his old favorite, &lsquo;Keep
right on to the end of the road,&rsquo; from &lsquo;Though the way
be long, let your heart be strong,&rsquo;&rdquo; wrote a woman at the
beginning of 1947. She was thus reminded that though
we take a long look backward at the close of a year, we
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
are also disposed to take a forward look when the New
Year dawns.</p>
<p>Then the woman went to the watch-night service at the
church. Soon she found herself singing with the others
the hymn written for this occasion by Charles Wesley:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, let us anew our journey pursue,</p>
<p class="t">Roll round with the year,</p>
<p class="t0">And never stand still till the Master appear.</p>
<p class="t0">His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,</p>
<p class="t">And our talents improve,</p>
<p class="t0">By the patience of hope, and the labor of love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Returning home, she confessed that she found herself
with the feeling that the Scotch minstrel and the English
hymn writer each had an appropriate message for the
human spirit.</p>
<h3 id="c7">The Hymn with Exclamation Points</h3>
<p>After Dr. Charles Kendall Gilbert was elected to succeed
Bishop William T. Manning as head of the Protestant
Episcopal diocese of New York in the latter part of
January, 1947, <i>The New York Times</i> said in an editorial:
&ldquo;It will now be his responsibility to build his church on
ever stronger foundations in a world beset by doubt,
bewilderment and confusion. But it is also an inspiring
task. The hymn sung before his election was dedicatory:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Rise up, O men of God!</p>
<p class="t">Have done with lesser things.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That hymn will be sung when everything else about
you is forgotten,&rdquo; the great pulpit orator of Brooklyn,
Dr. S. Parkes Cadman, once remarked to the author of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
vigorous hymn which both clergymen and laymen sang
together on that responsible day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every stanza has at least one exclamation point,&rdquo; remarked
Dr. Charles A. Boyd, when he called attention to
this peculiar feature of the hymn written by Dr. William
Pierson Merrill. In fact, out of the four stanzas in the
copy now in front of the writer, two of these have two
exclamation points each. The vivid style of this hymn,
therefore, is an emphatic call for speedy action. The hymn
was written to incite men to &ldquo;do something,&rdquo; and to do
it without delay. Hence the call:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Give heart and mind and soul and strength</p>
<p class="t">To serve the King of kings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn was written for a definite purpose and a
particular occasion. It came to us early in the twentieth
century when the Brotherhood movement was one of large
proportions in some of the great denominations in the
United States; and the large conventions which were held
in vital centers of the country were scenes of tremendous
enthusiasm. During that period Nolan R. Best, then editor
of <i>The Continent</i>, remarked to Dr. Merrill that there was
need of a Brotherhood hymn. The suggestion lingered in
the mind of the latter. About the same time (1911) Dr.
Merrill read an article by Gerald Stanley Lee on &ldquo;The
Church of Strong Men.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was on one of the Lake
Michigan steamers,&rdquo; Dr. R. G. McCutchen quotes him
as saying, &ldquo;going back to Chicago for a Sunday at my
own church, when suddenly this hymn came up, almost
without conscious thought or effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the hymn made an appeal to various denominations,
which included it in their revised hymnals. Other
countries, also, approvingly placed this hymn in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
new books. Thus it is found in <i>The Hymnary</i> of the
United Church of Canada, and <i>The Methodist Hymn
Book</i>, London. Dr. Merrill once said, &ldquo;It has given me
very deep satisfaction to have the hymn obtain such general
use. Several times each year I am asked for permission
to include it in some new collection of hymns.&rdquo; But,
as Dr. C. M. Washburn has remarked, &ldquo;Any hymnal is
enriched because of the inclusion of these challenging
lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A newspaper reporter (Ernest J. Bowden) in an upstate
city of New York has an assignment each Sunday
to attend a selected church, and then write his impressions.
He is peculiarly sensitive to the music rendered,
and often makes illuminating comments on the same. He
was peculiarly gratified when, on a December Sunday, he
was assigned to a Presbyterian church to report a visiting
minister. Thirty years earlier he had heard a new hymn
sung in a city in California, and he had remembered the
name of the writer. Now came the opportunity to hear
him. After the service he met the author, and the two
talked about Dr. Merrill&rsquo;s choice hymn. The author told
the newspaper man that while on a trip to Oriental missions
he had heard this hymn sung in both Japanese and
Chinese. Also, it was sung at a meeting in India which
he addressed. At the close of the gathering Dr. Merrill
said to the leader of the music, &ldquo;It was very thoughtful
of you to sing my hymn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know that you wrote it; we sang it because
we like it,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better still,&rdquo; continued Dr. Merrill. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the finest
tribute it could have received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sketch was then given by the reporter of Dr. Merrill,
in 1944, &ldquo;He is a genial soul, free and friendly as
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
the gospel he preached in Brick Church, New York. He
retired in 1938, and is now climbing toward eighty. But
you would never think it to see him. His voice rang clear
as a bell through every pew.&rdquo; Then, speaking as a layman,
he remarked: &ldquo;When a group of men have been
sitting for hours, or days, in conference, threshing over
the routine of church or community, what more fitting
climax could there be than the call to sing in parting:</p>

</div>
<p>The wide service rendered by this hymn to the Christian
Church is indicated by the fact that when the Bishop
of Ripon congratulated Dr. Merrill on having written
such a choice and practical hymn, he said: &ldquo;I use it at
every communion service in my diocese where young people
are received into the church.&rdquo; Thus did the Episcopalian
leader pay tribute to the appeal of the hymn written
by the eminent Presbyterian author. Doubtless this hymn
is destined to play a valiant part in helping to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Bring in the day of Brotherhood</p>
<p class="t">And end the night of wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>I cherish a program sent me by a friend who lives in a
Cornish town beyond the wide Atlantic. It outlined a
great service of thanksgiving for the return of peace held
in one of the largest churches in the county, when the
several churches of the community participated. The rector
of the parish and the several ministers of the town united
in conducting a carefully prepared service of hymns, responsive
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
readings, prayers and addresses. Thus they that
day remembered those who had fallen in World War II.
Then, in closing, those men, women and youth, which
packed the great building, led by a worthy choir, stood
and sang the hymn of our American author:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rise up, O men of God!</p>
<p class="t">The Church for you doth wait,</p>
<p class="t0">Her strength unequal to her task;</p>
<p class="t">Rise up, and make her great!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then came the closing stanza, with also two exclamation
points:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lift high the cross of Christ!</p>
<p class="t">Tread where His feet have trod;</p>
<p class="t0">As brothers of the Son of Man,</p>
<p class="t">Rise up, O men of God!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c9">The Morning Call</h3>
<p>Her father was a lay preacher, and she, a school teacher,
followed in his steps. She was in the pulpit on that Sunday
morning when an American citizen visited the country
of his birth, in the summer of 1946 to observe post-war
conditions. He was now amid familiar scenes in the far
south of England. The morning was full of glorious
sunshine, and he went to church as he had done when a
boy. Then he wrote an account of the service, and sent
it to his home folks.</p>
<p>What, he wondered, would be the hymn which this
&ldquo;spiritually and mentally disciplined woman&rdquo; might
select for the opening of the service. That question was
answered when this preacher-daughter of a preacher-father
announced the charming lines of Geoffrey A. Studdert
Kennedy:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Awake, awake to love and work,</p>
<p class="t">The lark is in the sky,</p>
<p class="t0">The fields are wet with diamond dew,</p>
<p class="t">The worlds awake to cry</p>
<p class="t0">Their blessings on the Lord of Life,</p>
<p class="t">As He goes meekly by.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There the visitor blended his voice with some of those
he had known in his boyhood days as they together worshipped
in the village church. The preacher stood in the
pulpit with the ease of one born to it, and &ldquo;joined in the
singing with the full-voiced enthusiasm of a thrush or
mockingbird on a spring morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This song is placed among the morning hymns in <i>The
Hymnal</i> of the Protestant Episcopal Church (1940).
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Imaginative and impressive is the language used in the
second verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,</p>
<p class="t">Shout with their shout of praise;</p>
<p class="t0">See how the giant sun roars up,</p>
<p class="t">Great Lord of years and days!</p>
<p class="t0">So let the love of Jesus come</p>
<p class="t">And set thy soul ablaze.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Woodbine Willie&rdquo; was the name, for some reason,
given to the author when he became a chaplain in World
War I. His was a charmed name in the army, and his experiences
there &ldquo;made him an enthusiast for peace.&rdquo; He
became a rector in London, and in 1924 he made a visit
to the United States and added many persons to the long
list of friends already his. Death came to him in Liverpool
in 1929. Someone characterized him as &ldquo;the wholly lovable
prophet of social righteousness.&rdquo; Through coming
years he will continue to speak to the hearts of many who
joyfully sing his inspiring morning hymn with its lilting
tune.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Morning Hymn on an Ocean Voyage</h3>
<p>Time for reflection is found on an ocean voyage, and,
as the writer and many others can testify, lasting impressions
are often made. Such an experience came to one
who was making a trip around the world in the days
between two world wars. &ldquo;The sea,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;was not a
friend of mine as we rode the mountainous waves for
nearly three weeks without a port of call.&rdquo; Much of the
time, indeed, he lay in his cabin simply watching the
rising and the falling of the waves through the porthole.</p>
<p>A Sunday morning, however, dawned fair and bright;
and he found himself &ldquo;able to make his way to the top
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
deck for divine worship.&rdquo; Never, he confessed, was he
more deeply touched by a hymn than when the company
of passengers, and some members of the crew, united in
singing as their opening hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;New every morning is the love</p>
<p class="t0">Our wakening and uprising prove;</p>
<p class="t0">Through sleep and darkness safely brought,</p>
<p class="t0">Restored to life and power and thought.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The memory of that hymn proved to be cheering and
invigorating. He later wrote: &ldquo;How beautiful this sunny
Sunday morning with no land, or fish, or bird in sight.
Just the sun, the sky, and the sea. How sacred the upper
deck seemed that morning! Can you not believe that I
never hear this hymn sung without again feeling the waves
lifting me, the scene crowding my brain with its poignancy&mdash;sea,
sky, sun, and God&rsquo;s care through another
night on the ocean waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brilliant scholar was John Keble, author of &ldquo;The
Christian Year,&rdquo; from which this hymn comes. It is regarded
as one &ldquo;of the greatest religious classics in the
English language.&rdquo; This tribute has been paid to this work
by Nutter and Tillett: &ldquo;What the Prayer Book is in prose
for public worship, &lsquo;The Christian Year&rsquo; is in poetry for
private devotion.&rdquo; Mentally suggestive are the lines which
have such a direct relation to daily living:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;New mercies, each returning day,</p>
<p class="t0">Hover around us while we pray;</p>
<p class="t0">New perils past, new sins forgiven,</p>
<p class="t0">New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c11">Morning Songs Fill the Day with Music</h3>
<p>Skilled in both the art and science of making lovely
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
gardens, Silas Kenton loved to sing while working. The
story of this interesting English gardener was related by
the Rev. S. Horton in &ldquo;Say It with Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Kenton,&rdquo; was the cheery greeting of
Lady Lawder, by whom he was employed, one day. Then
she added: &ldquo;You were singing early this morning, Silas.
I could hear you as I lay in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t disturb your ladyship,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I had forgotten the green-houses were so near your
room. It was thoughtless of me and I am sorry indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it did wake me up, but I didn&rsquo;t mind. What
was it you were singing? The tune was familiar to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an old favorite of mine,&rdquo; replied Silas:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!</p>
<p class="t">Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The musical gardener then made this observation:
&ldquo;You see, ma&rsquo;am, when the world gets busy, there are
doubtless thousands upon thousands of singers whose
songs are rising like sweet music to the skies. I like to
think that most mornings I&rsquo;m one of the earliest of the
Lord&rsquo;s servants offering my tribute of praise. Besides I
always think a few songs before breakfast fill the heart
with music all the day.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c12">Hymn Suggested by a &ldquo;Blaze of Leafage&rdquo;</h3>
<p>For eight months an English Episcopalian bishop confined
to a Japanese prison saw no sunlight. But this
prisoner of war did witness what he described as &ldquo;a
blaze of leafage on some trees.&rdquo; This sight recalled to the
mind of the bishop a hymn from the heart and pen of
Charles Wesley:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Christ, whose glory fills the skies,</p>
<p class="t">Christ, the true, the only Light,</p>
<p class="t0">Sun of righteousness, arise,</p>
<p class="t">Triumph o&rsquo;er the shades of night;</p>
<p class="t0">Day-Spring from on high, be near;</p>
<p class="t0">Day-Star, in my heart appear.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This experience which came to Dr. J. L. Wilson, Bishop
of Singapore, who was representing the Church of England,
stood out above all others, and represented the value
of a mind stored with memories of hymns. Three thousand
people listened most attentively for forty-five minutes in
the City Hall, Sheffield, England, in September, 1946, as
the speaker narrated experiences which can come only in
war time.</p>
<p>A reporter was among those who heard with amazement
the words of the bishop as he explained how,
charged with being a &ldquo;spy,&rdquo; he was &ldquo;imprisoned, tortured,
and flogged with ropes almost beyond endurance&rdquo;
by the Japanese. Four thousand persons were crowded into
a prison designed to accommodate seven hundred. They
were a courageous company, however. &ldquo;When men and
women came downstairs bleeding from torture, they might
not speak; but they smiled, and the others smiled back.&rdquo;
Bishop Wilson was the only &ldquo;European among Malayans,
Indians and Chinese.&rdquo; But his fellow-prisoners, observing
his firmness and forgiving spirit, asked him to teach them
to pray.</p>
<p>Bread and wine were lacking, but Bishop Wilson used
tea or water in the celebration of the Holy Communion
on Sundays. &ldquo;It might be irregular,&rdquo; the speaker remarked
with a smile; but he could not be convinced that it was
not valid. A Christian girl, he learned, was there for helping
the British, and the elements were passed through the
prison bars to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The hymn which lifted the soul of the imprisoned
bishop above his immediate surroundings came from the
singing spirit of Charles Wesley, and appeared in 1740
in his &ldquo;Hymns and Sacred Poems.&rdquo; The hymnology of
both British and American Methodism is enriched by the
inclusion of this song of worship; and it is also found in
the <i>Hymnal</i> of the Protestant Episcopal Church, <i>The
Hymnal</i> (Presbyterian), <i>The Hymnary</i> (of the United
Church of Canada), <i>The Inter-Church Hymnal</i>, etc. The
three verses will be found &ldquo;full of the sunshine of which
they sing,&rdquo; observed Dr. Charles S. Robinson. Lovers of
literature will be especially interested in a comment made
by Dr. James Moffatt, where he says, &ldquo;George Eliot uses
this hymn in <i>Adam Bede</i> describing how Seth Bede, the
young Methodist, on leaving his brother one Sunday morning
in February, &lsquo;walked leisurely homeward, mentally
repeating one of his favorite hymns.&rsquo; <i>It was this one.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Easy is it, therefore, for us to imagine Bishop Wilson,
the liberty-loving Englishman, confined to a sunless prison
in a foreign country, catching a glimpse of &ldquo;a blaze of
leafage on some trees,&rdquo; then refreshing his singing spirit
by mentally repeating the lines which he had often joined
with others in publicly singing when a youth in his homeland:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Dark and cheerless is the morn</p>
<p class="t">Unaccompanied by Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Joyless is the day&rsquo;s return</p>
<p class="t">Till Thy mercy&rsquo;s beams I see;</p>
<p class="t0">Till they inward light impart,</p>
<p class="t0">Cheer my eyes and warm my heart.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stone walls do not a prison make&rdquo; when one has a
song in his soul. And he who knows his hymnal well has
one for every occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the most successful numbers sung in the series of
Sunday evening concerts, which for several years it was my
privilege and pleasure to sponsor, was that old English hymn,
&lsquo;Now the Day is Over.&rsquo; That hymn marked the close of each
Sunday night concert, and the thousands of letters I received from
listeners throughout the country gave sure evidence that this old
religious song struck a responsive chord in the heart of listeners
everywhere.&rdquo;

</blockquote>
<p>A group of young men from an English theological college,
the &ldquo;Cliff College Trekkers,&rdquo; went, during the
summer of 1936, to Morecambe, and there this band of
energetic youth held Sunday services on the slipway.</p>
<p>Evening prayer was also held by them at the slipway,
and one who was present expressed gratitude through the
press for the privilege of sharing these moments of quiet
devotion. Following prayers, the entire company united in
singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All hail the power of Jesus&rsquo; name.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>People who had listened to the inspirational hymn were
doubtless singing in their hearts, as they walked to their
seaside residences, the glowing words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And crown Him Lord of all.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c14">Nature Gave the Perfect Touch</h3>
<p>Some of the great moments of a lifetime were experienced
by lovers of sacred music on an evening in late June,
1931, at the stadium of Cornell University. The Westminster
Choirs, arrayed in their resplendent robes, sang
under the leadership of the distinguished conductor, Dr.
J. Finley Williamson. A representative of The Syracuse
Post-Standard thus sketched the event for his newspaper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The scene:&mdash;Eleven harps were ranged on the velvet green
in front of the singers. The skies were hung with black clouds
for a canopy. The soft beauty of the marvellous scenery, as far
as the eye could reach, surrounded all. Lightning darted through
the clouds, and the low rumble of thunder was a background for
the celestial music of the harps as they played the hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Day is dying in the west;</p>
<p class="t">Heaven is touching earth with rest:</p>
<p class="t0">Wait and worship while the night</p>
<p class="t0">Sets her evening lamps alight</p>
<p class="t">Through all the sky.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the voices, in unison with the harps, hummed the
melody, it was something to be cherished in memory. Words fail
to describe adequately the impression. It was the perfect touch
that only nature is able to give to human effort.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During such sublime moments the musicians passed to
the close of the hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts!</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven and earth are full of Thee!</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven and earth are praising Thee,</p>
<p class="t">O Lord most high!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The music combined with the display of nature to induce
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
a mood which brought God very close to his earthly
children that June afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="c15">The Bells of Trinity</h3>
<p>Startled as he wandered rather aimlessly amid lower
New York, a distinguished visitor listened to the Bells of
Trinity Church as they joyously pealed forth the strains of:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hark, hark, my soul! angelic songs are swelling</p>
<p class="t">O&rsquo;er earth&rsquo;s green fields and ocean&rsquo;s wave-beat shore;</p>
<p class="t0">How sweet the truth those bless&egrave;d strains are telling</p>
<p class="t">Of that new life when sin shall be no more!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The music fell with soul-stirring effect on the ears of
Dr. John A. Hutton, long-time editor of <i>The British
Weekly</i>, who was in the United States, as he frequently
was in summer-time, to fulfill engagements in preaching
and lecturing.</p>
<p>The location of Trinity Church, whence came the eventide
music, deepened the interest in the hymn. Said Dr.
Hutton: &ldquo;I was hearing the Lord&rsquo;s song just where the
Lord&rsquo;s song stands in most need of being heard, and just
where the Lord&rsquo;s song sounds most sweetly. I was hearing
the Lord&rsquo;s song in a strange land.&rdquo; Down opposite
Wall street, &ldquo;Where Mammon holds the throne, dwarfed
and almost overshadowed by immense business and financial
houses, rises the spire of Trinity.&rdquo; Hence, &ldquo;where
men were engrossed in the things of time and sense, there
fell upon the ear a song that spoke of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most popular setting in America for this hymn is
&ldquo;Pilgrims&rdquo; by Henry Smart, with what H. Augustine
Smith calls its &ldquo;plaintive wistfulness.&rdquo; This hymn therefore,
according to Boyd, &ldquo;appeals to both the poetic sense
and the musical ear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Personally I have seen congregations deeply moved as
they have joined in singing, at an evening service of worship:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Angels, sing on! your faithful watches keeping;</p>
<p class="t">Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above;</p>
<p class="t0">Till morning&rsquo;s joy shall end the night of weeping,</p>
<p class="t">And life&rsquo;s long shadows break in cloudless love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c16">Singing Soldiers</h3>
<p>Fifteen soldiers were gathered together on a Thursday
evening in a little French village behind the line during
the First World War. Forming themselves into a semicircle
around the chaplain, Thomas Tiplady, who has
described the scene in &ldquo;The Cross at the Front,&rdquo; they
made choice of the hymn they would like sung to open
their devotional meeting. Then they joined in singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At even, ere the sun was set,</p>
<p class="t">The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;</p>
<p class="t0">O in what divers pains they met!</p>
<p class="t">O with what joy they went away!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Once more &rsquo;tis eventide, and we,</p>
<p class="t">Oppressed with various ills, draw near;</p>
<p class="t0">What if Thy form we cannot see?</p>
<p class="t">We know and feel that Thou art here.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The evening was still, and the voices of the men playing
football not far away were heard, as well as the sound
of guns. Yet as the men sang the birds were also singing
in some neighboring trees. Chaplain Tiplady makes this
observation: &ldquo;To him who has only sung this hymn in a
church much of its beauty must of necessity be hidden. It
is revealed only in the light of the setting sun. The men
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
were facing the Golden West. The pomp of the dying
day lay upon the rustling leaves of the trees and upon the
grass at our feet. It lit up with beauty the faces of the
men as they sang. Soon it would be gone, and the shadows
would wrap us round as with a mantle.&rdquo; But those Englishmen
in France sang their faith and prayer:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thy touch has still its ancient prayer,</p>
<p class="t">No word from Thee can fruitless fall;</p>
<p class="t0">Hear in this solemn evening hour,</p>
<p class="t">And in Thy mercy heal us all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c17">Hymn Discussion at Oyster Bay</h3>
<p>Captain Archibald W. Butt, personal aide to President
Theodore Roosevelt, spending a week-end at the Roosevelt
residence in Oyster Bay, N. Y., accompanied the
family to a morning service of worship on July 27, 1908,
at the Episcopal Church. Mrs. Roosevelt was a member
of this church. Mr. Roosevelt was a member of the Dutch
Reformed Church, but when in Oyster Bay he used to
worship with the family; and so, on this occasion, he took
Captain Butt, also an Episcopalian, with him. Later in the
day Captain Butt referred to the hymns sung in the service,
and, being from the South, made this observation:
&ldquo;I think the South likes strong, sentimental hymns, while
every one which was sung at Oyster Bay had some poetic
value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt sang hymns with zest, and enjoyed
variety. On this day, however, he declared that his favorite
hymn was:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Christ is made the sure Foundation,</p>
<p class="t">Christ the head and corner-stone,</p>
<p class="t0">Chosen of the Lord, and precious,</p>
<p class="t">Binding all the Church in one;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p class="t0">Holy Sion&rsquo;s help for ever,</p>
<p class="t">And her confidence alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This is a translation from an old Latin hymn by Dr.
John Mason Neale. Information concerning this hymn by
Dr. Charles S. Robinson is as follows: &ldquo;It is more popular
in England than it is on this side of the water, except,
perhaps, among Episcopalians, who, as a denomination,
seem very fond of it. It is used for corner-stone services,
and for dedications and the like, with much acceptance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>was given by Mr. Roosevelt as his next choice. But he
also expressed admiration for &ldquo;Jerusalem the Golden,&rdquo;
and very naturally for a man of his type:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Son of God goes forth to war.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt, on the other hand, named as her choice:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and also:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Art thou weary, art thou laden,</p>
<p class="t">Art thou sore distrest?</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Come to Me,&rsquo; saith One, &lsquo;and coming,</p>
<p class="t">Be at rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time I realized that I had no favorite
hymn,&rdquo; said Captain Butt in a letter which he wrote to
his mother that very night; and which, fortunately, has
been preserved in &ldquo;The Letters of Archie Butt.&rdquo; He
added: &ldquo;I have thought of it during the day, and I
believe that I shall take &lsquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,&rsquo; as my
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
favorite. It appeals to the sentimental side of me at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should like to have sung at my funeral,
&lsquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Butt in this letter.
Singularly enough, this was the last music which he heard
played before he died. He was drowned when the <i>Titanic</i>
sank; and the ship&rsquo;s band, which had been playing popular
music during the fateful period after the great ship had
struck an iceberg on a Sunday night, rendered as its last
selection, when the boat was going down and carrying
hundreds of the passengers and crew to a swift death in
the Atlantic:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The following interesting observation, which I have not
elsewhere seen, is made by Lawrence F. Abbott, who

<br /><span class="h2line2">SERENADING THE SOUL WITH SONG</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In London Town there are always queer, unexpected things
to be seen and heard. The other day my wife and I went out
to lunch, and we were waiting in a queue. Suddenly above the
noise of the busy street we heard a tin whistle being played.
The tune was &lsquo;<i>O Jesus, I have promised</i>&rsquo;&mdash;and it was played
very well, too. This was followed by ... &lsquo;<i>Jerusalem the
golden</i>.&rsquo; I looked, but couldn&rsquo;t see the musician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The queue moved up, and I was afraid I wasn&rsquo;t going to
see the tin whistle expert at all. But just as we got level with
the door I did see him. He was now giving a spirited rendering
of &lsquo;<i>The Church&rsquo;s one foundation</i>&rsquo;&mdash;and he was a grey-headed
old Negro. He wore what had been a very smartly cut
officer&rsquo;s tunic. The tune finished, the old fellow sat down on a
doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, I wondered, had he learned these hymn-tunes? And
where had that Lascar seaman in the street in West Hartlepool
learnt &lsquo;<i>There&rsquo;s a Friend for Little Children</i>?&rsquo;&mdash;for he was
humming it as he passed me by.&rdquo;
<span class="lr">&mdash;<i>F. H. E. in &ldquo;The Methodist Recorder,&rdquo; London.</i></span></p>
<p>Nothing is more beautiful than the sight of a company of
Christians singing their hymns of praise.
<span class="lr">&mdash;<i>Roy L. Smith.</i></span></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3 id="c19">That Was Yesterday!</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Samuel!&rdquo; exclaimed the surprised wife of the
beloved Bishop Samuel Fallows, one morning.</p>
<p>The story as related by Dr. Roy L. Smith referred to
a night when the ageing bishop returned from a rather
stormy meeting. Harsh things had been said, and he appeared
thoroughly discouraged. Entering the home, his
wife, with womanly instinct, sensed the situation. The
bishop even went to bed without partaking of his usual
cup of hot milk.</p>
<p>Full of understanding sympathy, his wife expected him
to remain in bed a little later than usual, and possibly
have breakfast taken to him. But when she quietly entered
his room, he was pulling the &ldquo;weights of his ancient
exercise machine.&rdquo; Meanwhile he was singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, Thou Fount of every blessing;</p>
<p class="t">Tune my heart to sing Thy grace,</p>
<p class="t0">Streams of mercy, never ceasing,</p>
<p class="t">Call for songs of loudest praise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>All this was so unexpected that the good and anxious
woman, in her astonishment, could only say, &ldquo;Why,
Samuel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why what?&rdquo; questioned the bishop, without missing
a beat in the rhythm of his morning exercise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that board meeting last night. I thought you
would stay in bed this morning, and try to get a bit of
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That board meeting, what about it?&rdquo; he asked, as he
came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it must have been terrible. You came home utterly
spent and discouraged,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Resuming his exercise, the bishop quietly remarked,
&ldquo;O that was yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentle man would not permit what happened yesterday
to take from him his praiseful song.</p>
<p>Therefore as he continued to pull his exercise machine
he resumed the singing of his hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here I raise mine Ebenezer;</p>
<p class="t">Hither by Thy help I&rsquo;m come;</p>
<p class="t0">And I hope by Thy good pleasure,</p>
<p class="t">Safely to arrive at home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c20">Song of the Hidden Singer</h3>
<p>A woman of culture was standing in a large London
store waiting to be served. The customers were many, and
some of them became impatient. Tired and irritated, occasionally
someone would make an unpleasant remark.</p>
<p>Somewhere up toward the roof, a workman, invisible
to the one who narrated the incident, was busy making
structural alterations. Said Mrs. G. Elsie Harrison: &ldquo;As
he worked above us, like some ham-strung lark, he
carolled.&rdquo; The notes that fluttered down to her were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Tell me the old, old story</p>
<p class="t">Of unseen things above,</p>
<p class="t0">Of Jesus and His glory,</p>
<p class="t">Of Jesus and His love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Old memories were revived by the song. Mrs. Harrison
thus indicated her own experience: &ldquo;In one moment the
arrogant shoppers had vanished. I was at home again, and
saw my mother at the piano, and heard the music which
only she could make to sound so reverent. Her generation
really meant it when they sang:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me the story softly,</p>
<p class="t">With earnest tones and grave;</p>
<p class="t0">Remember, I&rsquo;m the sinner</p>
<p class="t">Whom Jesus came to save.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To them it was a real sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving,
and the music matched the mood.</p>
<p>Popular with older people, this hymn of Miss Katherine
Hankey, an English lady, has also been a favorite with
children. The tune to which it is mostly sung was composed
by William H. Doane, an American musician.</p>
<p>The London singer was hidden, and singing just for
himself. But the song brought back beautiful memories to
at least one woman amid the crowd of shoppers.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Americans Sang with the Japanese Lady</h3>
<p>A lady from Japan, Madame Yoshika Sait&oacute;, Tokyo,
was one of the distinguished visitors to the historic Uniting
Conference of The Methodist Church in Kansas City,
May, 1939. She was introduced by Dr. James R. Houghton,
Boston University, who had charge of the music; and
Dr. Houghton announced that the visitor would sing
&ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo; by Mozart.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Bond, a former president of the Methodist
Conference, England, was so impressed by the Japanese
lady that he wrote back to one of the periodicals of his
native England saying: &ldquo;Madame Sait&oacute;, both by her personal
charm and her exquisite voice, captured the Conference.</p>
<p>Madame Sait&oacute;, responsive to the purpose and the spiritual
atmosphere of the Uniting Conference, then followed
with the verse of a hymn, which she sang both in
her native tongue and also in English:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I need Thee every hour,</p>
<p class="t">Most gracious Lord;</p>
<p class="t0">No tender voice like Thine</p>
<p class="t">Can peace afford.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Bishop Charles L. Mead, the presiding officer, suggested
that the Uniting Conference would probably like to sing
the verse and the chorus with the visitor. Soon the Japanese
lady, the nine hundred delegates, and thousands of visitors
were singing together:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I need Thee, O I need Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Every hour I need Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">O bless me now, my Saviour,</p>
<p class="t">I come to Thee!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of those rare moments,&rdquo; said Dr. Bond to
his English readers, &ldquo;when a great tide of emotions
sweeps over a big assembly and carries it out of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c22">Northfield&rsquo;s Festival of Sacred Music</h3>
<p>The Northfield Festival of Sacred Music when introduced
into the program of the Northfield General Conference
in the decade preceding World War II proved to
be a thrilling moving event. Coming on the closing Sunday
of the many summer programs, it brought immense
crowds to the annual gathering at East Northfield which
D. L. Moody made so popular by the list of distinguished
speakers that he enlisted from British and American
pulpits and educational institutions.</p>
<p>The fact that the Westminster Choir Summer School
was holding its sessions at Mount Hermon, just a short
distance across the river, with Dr. John Finley Williamson
at its head, made possible Northfield&rsquo;s festival of
sacred music. Choirs from neighboring communities united
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
with the group at the summer school, and for six weeks
five hundred singers prepared for the memorable occasion.</p>
<p>Twice the writer was in attendance. Much alike each
year, yet particular interest attached itself to 1937. This
was the season of the D. L. Moody Centenary Celebration,
and the fifty-eighth session of the Northfield General
Conference. The Festival Choir was divided into a few
different groups for various purposes. Yet when the hymns
were sung these all participated, and the audience was
invited to join them.</p>
<p>Within five minutes after the entrances were opened
the great auditorium was filled. People also stood in a
solid line near the walls. Newspapers reported that about
two thousand additional people also stood outside in the
hot sun during the rendering of the program, a part of
which was broadcast.</p>
<p>The audience, inside and outside the building, had its
first opportunity to sing when they united in Luther&rsquo;s
soul-stirring hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A mighty fortress is our God,</p>
<p class="t">A bulwark never failing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The singing company made the most of it. &ldquo;The very
walls shook,&rdquo; said my friend in the next seat.</p>
<p>The next hymn selection was that which came from
Toplady. This the audience knew well, and sang with
affectionate enthusiasm:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rock of Ages, cleft for me,</p>
<p class="t">Let me hide myself in Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Happy was the surprise which came with the next
hymn. Mrs. W. R. Moody, daughter-in-law of D. L.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Moody, seated herself at the keyboard of a small instrument
which, before it was opened up, looked like a big
packing case. Really it was the small organ which accompanied
Moody and Sankey during their nation-wide
evangelistic campaigns; for the latter always wanted, if
possible, to have his own instrument with him. Hence
the little organ was made for this purpose. The instrument
had been on display in the Moody exhibit at Moody&rsquo;s
boyhood home during the special days of the Moody Centennial.
Visitors could there sit in the spacious chair used
by Moody himself, sign their names; and, by permission,
play on Sankey&rsquo;s organ. Musicians loved to do so. The
Westminster singers now rendered the beloved gospel
song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There were ninety and nine that safely lay</p>
<p class="t">In the shelter of the fold,</p>
<p class="t0">But one was out on the hills away,</p>
<p class="t">Far off from the gates of gold&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Away on the mountains wild and bare</p>
<p class="t0">Away from the tender Shepherd&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Joy beamed on the countenance of Mrs. Moody as she
led the singers on the historic little organ; and the song
continued through the lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;But all through the mountains, thunder-riven,</p>
<p class="t">And up from the rocky steep,</p>
<p class="t0">There arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The conductor at this point gave a signal to the enraptured
audience, and everybody joined the special
singers in the triumphant lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Rejoice! I have found my sheep!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And the angels echoed around the throne,</p>
<p class="t0">Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>This musical climax was dramatic. The great company
had evidently coveted the privilege of singing with Sankey&rsquo;s
organ, and particularly in joining in this song. Now
it came, and they made the most of it. &ldquo;Singing such as
that I never expect to hear again this side of heaven,&rdquo;
said a woman whose soul had caught a vision of the lost
sheep which had, at last, been found.</p>
<p>Just one more hymn remained to be sung before the
Choral Benediction of Peter Lutkin was rendered by the
great chorus. This was the familiar hymn of Isaac Watts,
which we sang to the tune of Hamburg:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When I survey the wondrous cross,</p>
<p class="t">On which the Prince of Glory died,</p>
<p class="t0">My richest gain I count but loss,</p>
<p class="t">And pour contempt on all my pride.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Both hymn and tune are universal favorites,&rdquo; affirmed
Dr. Charles A. Boyd after he examined sixteen hymnals
and found the hymn in each of them. In all but two it
was set to Hamburg.</p>
<p>Three verses of the hymn were sung, as requested, very
softly. Then the last verse was sung louder, until, in
mighty volume, the long-remembered service closed with
the lines of personal consecration:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Love so amazing, so divine,</p>
<p class="t">Demands my soul, my life, my all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">HYMNS OF COMFORT</span></h2>

<p>In the darkest hours of the war Mr. Winston Churchill

<p>&ldquo;When I cannot sleep at night I silently repeat hymns,&rdquo;
once said Mrs. Margaret E. Sangster to a caller. First in
the list, she intimated, was the cherished hymn of John
Newton, who &ldquo;loved much because he was forgiven
much&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How sweet the name of Jesus sounds</p>
<p class="t">In a believer&rsquo;s ear!</p>

<p class="t">And drives away his fear.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It makes the wounded spirit whole,</p>

<h3 id="c24">God&rsquo;s Angels in Charge</h3>
<p>A characteristic of Alice Freeman Palmer, who at the
age of twenty-six became the President of Wellesley College,
was her calmness. What would terrify another would
leave her undisturbed. From her early girlhood she had
learned the lesson of Christian trustfulness. Her husband,
Dr. George Herbert Palmer, who wrote the story of her
life, records the fact that one day, while at her summer
home at Boxford, she was ill in bed. A thunderstorm
came swiftly out of the southwest and struck the house,
and the room next to her own was destroyed. &ldquo;She seemed
at the time much interested in the novel event, as if it
were something contrived for her entertainment.&rdquo; After
her death, however, he found among her papers a hymn
with that date attached. This was sung at the memorial
service held in Harvard Chapel; and Doctor Palmer
printed it under the title of &ldquo;The Tempest.&rdquo; Suggestions
from the Psalms find expression in this poem, and the
opening lines conform closely to Psalm 91:11, which
reads:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For he will give his angels charge over thee,</p>
<p class="t">To keep thee in all thy ways.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The hymn of Mrs. Palmer reveals a spirit of confidence
in the power and love of God, and she felt comforted by
the fact that she could nestle into the strong arms of God.
These are her words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He shall give His angels charge</p>
<p class="t">Over thee in all thy ways.</p>
<p class="t0">Though the thunders roam at large,</p>
<p class="t">Though the lightning round me plays,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p class="t0">Like a child I lay my head</p>
<p class="t0">In sweet sleep upon my bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Though the terror come so close,</p>
<p class="t">It shall have no power to smite;</p>
<p class="t0">It shall deepen my repose,</p>
<p class="t">Turn the darkness into light.</p>
<p class="t0">Touch of angels&rsquo; hands is sweet;</p>
<p class="t0">Not a stone shall hurt my feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All Thy waves and billows go</p>
<p class="t">Over me to press me down</p>
<p class="t0">Into arms so strong I know</p>
<p class="t">They will never let me drown.</p>
<p class="t0">Ah, my God, how good Thy will!</p>
<p class="t0">I will nestle and be still.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c25">Singing Welshmen at Oxford</h3>
<p>A scene which greatly impressed him was related by
Frederick M. Davenport, a former member of congress,
when he returned from a trip to England late in the
summer of 1937. Mentioning the distressed area of the
coal district of South Wales, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As we were leaving Oxford one morning there appeared on
the station platform about a hundred young Welshmen between
eighteen and twenty years of age. They were dressed in the
garb of manual laborers, and held rough baggage in their hands.
Their home was in South Wales, but they had been in Oxford
working on a government project and were leaving for a holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly all Welsh are singers, and these young men were no
exception. After a few jolly songs directed at their leaders, as
their train was nearly due to leave they massed themselves together
and sang magnificently:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,</p>
<p class="t">Pilgrim through this barren land;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p class="t0">I am weak, but Thou art mighty;</p>
<p class="t">Hold me with Thy powerful hand;</p>
<p class="t2">Bread of heaven,</p>
<p class="t">Feed me till I want no more.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;For the time being they were unemployed at home,... but
they were full of confidence and good will.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hymn, &ldquo;a genuine heart song,&rdquo; comes from Welsh
sources; and one of the tunes to which it is sung, &ldquo;Cwm
Rhondda,&rdquo; composed by a Welshman, is a favorite among
Welsh people.</p>
<p>The group of young Welshmen who sang in Oxford
that day, while some Americans were among the listeners,
showed a courageous spirit, a love of hymns, and a devotional
attitude. Doubtless their song was a prayer of the
heart:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Guide me, O Thou Great Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c26">Singing Amid Suffering</h3>
<p>&ldquo;She truly learned in suffering what she taught in
song,&rdquo; someone remarked concerning the author of the
hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There is no sorrow, Lord, too light</p>
<p class="t">To bring in prayer to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">There is no anxious care too slight</p>
<p class="t">To wake Thy sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Rev. J. H. Jowett, D.D., the great expository
preacher who left his Birmingham pastorate in England
to serve the Fifth Avenue pastorate in New York City
during the second decade of the twentieth century, made
this his favorite hymn. Few knew hymns, especially of a
devotional nature, better than he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>This hymn came from the pen and heart of Jane Fox
Crewdson. Cornwall was her birthplace, 1809; but after
her marriage to a merchant of Manchester at the age of
27, she lived her life in that city until her death in 1863.
Many years of her life were spent in the sick room. Gifted
with poetic talent, she wrote many poems and hymns.
Most of these were &ldquo;composed amid paroxysms of pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most appropriately did a Presbyterian minister in an
American city, where he had served for 24 years, select
this hymn for Memorial Day Sunday in 1947. At the entrance
to the building a member of the church had placed
a basket of lovely flowers before the bronze tablet which
recorded the names of men who had served in the World
Wars. Comforting must have been the words of Mrs.
Crewdson&rsquo;s hymn to those who had suffered the loss of
those dear to them in the war period:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou, who hast trod the thorny road,</p>
<p class="t">Wilt share each small distress;</p>
<p class="t0">The love which bore the greater load,</p>
<p class="t">Will not refuse the less.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Not simply in the land where the author lived and
wrote are her hymns found, but this one also appears in
<i>The Hymnal</i> (Presbyterian) in the United States and <i>The
Hymnary</i> of The United Church of Canada. Dr. James
Moffatt quotes from an unnamed author this testimony
relating to the writer: &ldquo;As a constant sufferer, the spiritual
life deepening, and the intellectual life retaining all
its power, she became well prepared to testify to the all-sufficiency
of her Saviour&rsquo;s love.&rdquo; Hence we can appreciate
what has been said concerning the third verse, namely,
&ldquo;There is infinite pathos packed into these lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;There is no secret sigh we breathe,</p>
<p class="t">But meets Thine ear divine;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p class="t0">And every cross grows light beneath</p>
<p class="t">The shadow, Lord, of Thine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c27">Songs of a Sorrowing Nation</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell the kind of a man he was from the
hymns he loved. Our organist and our choir know. He
felt those hymns inwardly.&rdquo; These words were spoken by
the 78-year-old rector, the Rev. George W. Anthony, at
the morning service of worship conducted by him on
Sunday, April 15, 1945, in St. James Episcopal Church
at Hyde Park, N. Y., within a few minutes after President
Franklin D. Roosevelt was laid to rest in the &ldquo;rose
garden&rdquo; on his own estate.</p>
<p>Probably never before did the people of the United
States hear so many of the hymns of the Christian Church
played so frequently as during those days of sorrowing
for the President of the nation who died suddenly on
April 12. They began to be heard soon after the first announcement
was made to a stunned people, and continued
until Sunday, the 15th, when the beloved leader was
buried amid the scenes he loved. Commercial programs
were cancelled, and the radio devoted itself to news concerning
the passing of the president and events thereto
related. &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; and familiar hymns,
mostly the favorites of President Roosevelt, were frequently
heard.</p>
<p>Hymns were intimately associated with each movement
of the body as it made its journey from Warm Springs,
Georgia, where the president died, until it reached its
final resting-place. When on Friday the folks of the community
assembled to witness the departure of the train
which would carry him to Washington Chief Petty Officer
Graham Jackson, a Negro, who was a favorite with Mr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Roosevelt, stepped from the circle of mourners. He had
with him his accordion which Mr. Roosevelt loved to hear
him play. Now, as a last tribute, he &ldquo;played the haunting
strains of &lsquo;Going Home&rsquo; from the New World
Symphony. Then he played, &lsquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great crowds gathered to witness the passing of the
train which bore the body toward Washington. They were
reverent and tearful. A rather striking incident occurred
at Charlotte, N. C., where the train moved slowly through
the station without stopping. Street intersections were
thronged for blocks with mourners. The silence was
broken as the train passed by a troop of assembled Boy
Scouts who started to sing, &ldquo;Onward, Christian Soldiers,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the crowd took up the hymn in a ringing chorus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the caisson which bore the body from the railroad
station at Washington halted &ldquo;before the main
white-columned portico the casket was borne into the
White House by uniformed members of the armed services.&rdquo;
The Navy Band played &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner.&rdquo;
Then, outside on the lawn, &ldquo;a service band played
an old tune, &lsquo;Abide with Me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U. S. Marine Band which was present when the
train arrived at Washington followed the national anthem
with &ldquo;The Old Rugged Cross&rdquo; as the casket was placed
on the black-draped military caisson.</p>
<p>Because the hymns used at the funeral service in the
White House on the afternoon of Saturday, April 14, were
familiar, The Right Rev. Angus Dun, Episcopal Bishop of
Washington, who was in charge, with other clergymen
assisting, mentioned the fact that these hymns were
favorites of Mr. Roosevelt, and invited the assembled
company to join in the singing. The Navy Hymn, &ldquo;Eternal
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Father, Strong to Save,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faith of Our Fathers&rdquo;
were sung at this time.</p>
<p>Next day the body of President Roosevelt was back in
Hyde Park. The great chieftain had reached journey&rsquo;s end.
&ldquo;Between the manor house and the new library is the
rose garden where the grave has been dug,&rdquo; said <i>The New
York Times</i>. And there at ten o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning
was brought the body of the man who loved to visit this
garden when the flowers, especially the roses, were sending
forth their beauty and their fragrance. Probably it was
because of this fact that many radio programs and church
services placed in their musical programs the familiar
sacred song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I come to the garden alone,</p>
<p class="t0">While the dew is still on the roses</p>
<p class="t">And the voice I hear,</p>
<p class="t">Falling on my ear,</p>
<p class="t0">The Son of God discloses.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At the head of the procession in Hyde Park, as the body
was taken from the train to its resting-place, was the Army
band from West Point, with &ldquo;its members in uniforms
composed of dark blue tunic, lighter blue trousers with
white stripes. Their silver instruments gleamed.&rdquo; First
there were the sounds of muffled drums. Then the band
took up Chopin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Funeral March.&rdquo; Six hundred West
Pointers &ldquo;formed a solid phalanx facing the grave from
the west. The brief rites were conducted by the Rev.
George W. Anthony, the venerable rector. It was brief
and simple. As the body was lowered into the grave he
intoned the opening lines of the widely used hymn of
John Ellerton:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now the laborer&rsquo;s task is o&rsquo;er;</p>
<p class="t">Now the battle day is past;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p class="t0">Now upon the farther shore</p>
<p class="t">Lands the voyager at last.</p>
<p class="t0">Father, in Thy gracious keeping</p>
<p class="t0">Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hymns had been the life-long study and delight&rdquo; of
Ellerton (1826-93), an English Clergyman of the Episcopal
Church.</p>
<p>A file of West Pointers fired three volleys. &ldquo;As the last
volley sounded, as if it were one shot, muffled drums beat
again. At the head of the grave a bugler sounded taps.&rdquo;
Then, as Stevenson wrote, &ldquo;Here he lies where he longed
to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour of morning worship in St. James&rsquo; Church was
near, and so many of the people went to the little church
for the 11 o&rsquo;clock service. The building was crowded. But
&ldquo;the Roosevelt pew was empty. Here Franklin Roosevelt
sat, boy and man, for almost sixty years.&rdquo; An American
flag marked the pew on this day. Congregation and choir
sang, &ldquo;How Firm a Foundation.&rdquo; When he announced
&ldquo;O Master, Let Me Walk With Thee,&rdquo; the clergyman
stated, as he glanced toward the Roosevelt pew, that the
hymns selected were loved by Mr. Roosevelt. &ldquo;He is now
at rest in the community which he loved,&rdquo; said the speaker.</p>
<p>The next hymn sung is not widely known in this country
outside the Episcopal Church, though it is found in <i>The
Church Hymnary</i>, Scotland. Its author was Arthur Campbell
Ainger (1841-1919), who after his graduation from
Cambridge University spent most of his life in teaching
at Eton. He was &ldquo;one of the most distinguished of Eton
masters, a man of clear head, controlling character, wide
accomplishments,&rdquo; and he also wrote several hymns. The
hymn begins:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;God is working His purpose out</p>
<p class="t">As year succeeds to year.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The minister related the fact that Mr. Roosevelt loved
growing things, especially; and called attention to the extraordinary
coincidence that the church envelopes for that
day carried a &ldquo;Garden Prayer&rdquo;: &ldquo;Help us, O Lord, to
grasp the meaning of happy, growing things, that we may
weave it into the tissue of our faith in life eternal....
We thank Thee, O Lord, for gardens and their message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soloist now sang, &ldquo;O Rest in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard Graves moved to the corner beside the altar
and bore a large American flag forward in the chancel.
The ushers took their places beside him. The choir, the
organ and the congregation merged in fervent chorus with
&ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner.&rdquo; A prayer, and the service
closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a good friend. He was a good neighbor,&rdquo; said
a parishioner as she left the sanctuary with tear-dimmed
eyes.</p>
<p>Hymns were sung by an all-high-school chorus at City
Hall Park, New York City, on Saturday afternoon, following
the one minute of silence, and these included &ldquo;O
God, Our Help in Ages Past.&rdquo; Fifty thousand people
were present and many joined in the singing. A memorial
service was held in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine,
and seven thousand people were gathered an hour before
the service began on Saturday afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock.
The hymns there sung were &ldquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O God, Our Help in Ages Past.&rdquo;
Communities all over the nation also held services at the
hour when the funeral was held in the White House and
in thousands of churches, public squares and parks, after
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
the moment of silence in which traffic was hushed, and
men and women stood with bowed heads, some of the
hymns already mentioned were sung. &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of My
Soul&rdquo; was sometimes included. Many of these programs
also included &ldquo;America the Beautiful,&rdquo; and, of course,
our beloved national hymn, &ldquo;My Country, &rsquo;Tis of Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who could not leave their homes were still enabled
to listen to these services (and perhaps join in the
singing of the hymns). &ldquo;The networks,&rdquo; said an editor,
&ldquo;gave an impressive picture of the tribute being paid to
a departed leader from one end of the country to another.
One joined the solemn throng in front of the City Hall
in New York, or sat in a great cathedral in Boston.
Swiftly from the Eastern seaboard to the Far West, the
radio gave us glimpses of memorial services in Chicago,
in Kansas City, in Dallas and in Seattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An appreciative letter to an editor by a woman said of
those days from the death to the burial of Mr. Roosevelt,
&ldquo;Along with our grief and tears we were given an
uplift such as the broadcasting companies have never
given us before for a period of time like that.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">OCCASIONS TO REMEMBER</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Once I remember taking a service while the shells screamed
over us into Ypres. And as the men were singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Cover my defenseless head</p>
<p class="t">With the shadow of Thy wing,&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>one that fell short came hurtling, landing not two yards away&mdash;a
dud.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dr. A. J. Gossip in &ldquo;The British Weekly.&rdquo;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What was the greatest moment of all?&rdquo; That was the
question put to General Evangeline Booth of the Salvation
Army when she was 81 (Christmas Day, 1946), by
Dorothy Walworth, who narrated the interview in The
Christian Herald.</p>
<p>Retired, yet in good health and still working hard, this
magnetic speaker, whom I once heard as she thrilled a
mighty audience with her fervent oratory, paused a moment.
As daughter of the founder, and later his honored
successor in its leadership, there had been many high
moments. Then came her answer with conviction as she
related that her finest experience came on a day which she
spent in the Leper Colony in Poethenkuruz, in southern
India, where a chorus of little leper girls had been trained
to sing one of the hymns she wrote for the Army. They
stood before her in their dainty white dresses. Faces and
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
hands were badly scarred, &ldquo;but their voices were clear
and true. As they reached the words in the hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;With all my heart, I&rsquo;ll do my part,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>They put their tiny scarred hands over their hearts, and
I was overcome,&rdquo; said Miss Booth.</p>
<p>Princess Elizabeth (prospective Queen of England) was
married to Prince Philip on November 20, 1947. This was
the centennial of the death of Henry F. Lyte. The Princess,
therefore, arranged for the rendering of his hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Praise, my soul, the King of heaven,</p>
<p class="t">To His feet thy tribute bring,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>when the bridal party entered Westminster Abbey. &ldquo;This
same hymn,&rdquo; said <i>The Diapason</i>, &ldquo;was also sung at the
wedding of King George and Queen Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h3 id="c29">&ldquo;Abide with Me&rdquo; in a Submarine</h3>
<p>Fiction has rarely given us anything more arrestingly
strange than the following narration of a few minutes of
life with their bewildering experience. The story was related
in <i>The Methodist Recorder</i>, London, in its issue of
December 19, 1946, and is here reproduced in the exact
words of the writer, Campbell Marr of Kirkaldy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the early days of the war (World War II) a British submarine
was trapped at the bottom of the Heligoland Bight
through an unlocated defect in the machinery. In frantic despair
the engineers endeavored to find the fault, but without success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the oxygen supply was almost exhausted the lieutenant
in charge assembled the crew and told them that the situation
was beyond all hope. He gave each man an opiate so that death
might be made easier. Someone started to sing that very popular
hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Abide with me,&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and they all joined in. Suddenly one man swooned, and fell into
the machinery and immediately the lights went on and the engine
commenced to buzz. The man in his fall had operated a lever
which in the light of the hand torches had been overlooked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few minutes they had surfaced, and were thanking God
for their miraculous deliverance. Many of these men are now
back in civilian life, and not one of them is ever likely to forget
that grand old hymn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c30">Wheel Chair Singers</h3>
<p>We looked long at the unusual picture which stood out
prominently on the front page of our morning newspaper
(an AP Wirephoto). The item carried the heading which
we are using. A group of twenty-five singers was shown,
and they all sat in wheel chairs. They were all polio
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
patients, and among them were several naval officers. A
special article in <i>The New York Times</i> supplied additional
details.</p>
<p>The courageous singers were seated in the little white
chapel in Warm Springs, Georgia, where President F. D.
Roosevelt last attended a service of worship. Now, two
years after his sudden passing, a memorial service was
being conducted for him. This was on April 12, 1947,
and three hundred polio victims and villagers were present&mdash;the
patients also occupied wheel chairs. An overflow
company of two hundred were outside on the greensward
in front of the chapel, and listened to the service which
was conveyed to them by loudspeakers.</p>
<p>The pew in which President Roosevelt always sat when
he was at Warm Springs was reserved. Warm Springs was
the place to which he often went when making his heroic
fight with his affliction. The health-giving sources which
he there found were greatly helpful. It was there that
death came suddenly to him; there the Little White
House stands; and there State Guards have maintained
constant vigil since his translation. The American flag
was on that day at half staff at the unpretentious cottage
where he spent restful, though busy, days.</p>
<p>The leader of the Wheel Chair Choir, Mr. Fred Botts,
also occupied a wheel chair as he directed his group of
plucky singers&mdash;young people who were there for treatment.
For the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation is the
largest center in the world for the treatment of poliomyelitis.
Thither go patients from every state in the union.</p>
<p>One newspaper supplied the thing I wanted to know,
for I wondered what hymns would be sung by such an
exceptional choir&mdash;young people fighting with determination
for their health and their future. First came:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Faith of our fathers! living still.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The second hymn which the Wheel Chair Singers led the
congregation in singing on that pleasant April day was
one which is peculiarly impressive:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side;</p>
<p class="t">Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;</p>
<p class="t0">Leave to thy God to order and provide;</p>
<p class="t">In every change He faithful will remain.</p>
<p class="t0">Be still, my soul; thy best, thy heavenly Friend</p>
<p class="t">Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn by Katharina von Schlegel appeared in 1752,
and very little is known of the writer. It was &ldquo;adequately
translated&rdquo; by Jane Laurie Bothwick (1813-1897) of
Edinburgh. While visiting Switzerland, a friend suggested
that she translate some German hymns in which she was
interested. Therefore she and her sister, Sarah Bothwick
Findlater, worked together in translating <i>Hymns From the
Land of Luther</i>.</p>
<p>Comforting and challenging must have been the appeal
to the hearts of the crippled patients as there came to
their lips the words of the second verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be still, my soul, thy God doth undertake</p>
<p class="t">To guide the future as he has the past.</p>
<p class="t0">Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;</p>
<p class="t">All now mysterious shall be bright at last.</p>
<p class="t0">Be still, my soul: the winds and waves still know</p>
<p class="t">His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Times there are in life when not only the occupants of
wheel chairs, but also the rest of us, may serenade our
souls by singing or quoting that bravely suggestive line:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c31">Sang the Hymn from Memory</h3>
<p>When Theodore Roosevelt was running for the presidency
in 1912, he spent a weekend with William Allen
White in Emporia, Kansas. The plan was to take him to
the Congregational Church on Sunday morning for worship,
but the guest asked if there were not a German
Lutheran Church in town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was, and I took him there,&rdquo; said White.</p>
<p>A feature that impressed the host is related in <i>The
Autobiography of William Allen White</i>. Both building
and congregation were small. Naturally everybody stared
at Roosevelt in amazement. But the preacher lined out the
hymns, and White was delighted to note that Roosevelt
stood with the congregation and sang three stanzas of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>without taking up the hymnal. He showed no hesitation
concerning the words.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, White did not know that the hymn
was one of Roosevelt&rsquo;s favorites. Both Andrew Jackson
and Robert E. Lee were fond of it; and it was used at the
funerals of both Lee and Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Its frequent use in services of worship in the United
States is indicated by the fact that it is placed second in
the <i>Inter-Church Hymnal</i> by Morgan and Ward (1930).</p>
<p>An early memory of the writer is that of an old man
at a large religious gathering. During the evening this
hymn was sung. He stood erect and with face aglow as
he joined in the singing. He had seen much of life and
doubtless realized from personal experience the reality of
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the words he was singing. Possibly he was recalling some
specific hours in life; for when the third verse was reached,
he lifted his face and continued to sing with others:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When through the deep waters I call thee to go,</p>
<p class="t0">The rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;</p>
<p class="t0">For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,</p>
<p class="t0">And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The tears now began to flow down his cheeks; but he
sang clear to the closing lines as he continued to wipe
away the tears:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The soul that on Jesus still leans for repose</p>
<p class="t0">I will not, I will not desert to his foes.</p>
<p class="t0">That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll never, no never, no never, forsake.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This is a good memory hymn, for its assurances are
fitted to many situations and emergencies of life.</p>
<h3 id="c32">Hymn Expressed the Hearer&rsquo;s Feelings</h3>
<p>&ldquo;That hymn expresses exactly what I have felt for
years. How often I have wanted &lsquo;A little shrine of quietness,
all sacred to myself.&rsquo; How often have I wanted &lsquo;a
little shelter from life&rsquo;s stress.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was what a hearer said to a New Jersey minister,
the Rev. Daniel Lyman Ridout, at the close of worship
during which the clergyman read the words of John Oxenham,
while his daughter accompanied him on the piano
&ldquo;with reverent insight&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mid all the traffic of the ways&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Turmoils without, within&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Make in my heart a quiet place,</p>
<p class="t">And come and dwell therein.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Oxenham&rsquo;s hymn expresses the desire of the soul in
life&rsquo;s supreme moments. This hymn was written during
World War I, when the &ldquo;sorrow of the human race was
most acute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing under the name of John Oxenham, the author&rsquo;s
real name is William Arthur Dunkerley. Following his
education in Victoria University, Manchester, he followed
a business career. He spent some time in the United States,
and also traveled extensively in Europe and Canada. &ldquo;He
began writing as a relief from business,&rdquo; we are told.
Finding that he enjoyed writing more, he &ldquo;dropped business
and stuck to writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A most unusual note is sounded in this hymn. The
heart of the mystic calls for:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A little shrine of quietness,</p>
<p class="t">All sacred to Thyself,</p>
<p class="t0">Where Thou shalt all my soul possess,</p>
<p class="t">And I may find myself.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In a little private chapel down in the south of England
he found the little &ldquo;shrine of quietness&rdquo; which he
coveted. Thence he would go to &ldquo;sit and think,&rdquo; and
realize his desire for:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A little place of mystic grace,</p>
<p class="t">Of self and sin swept bare,</p>
<p class="t0">Where I may look upon Thy face,</p>
<p class="t">And talk with Thee in prayer.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c33">Hymn of the Homesick American</h3>
<p>Leading representatives of every department of English
public life assembled to do honor to one &ldquo;who had
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
labored, during the six years he had been ambassador, to
promote good-will between the sister nations.&rdquo; This was
on May 6, 1905, when Joseph Hodges Choate was entertained
at a farewell banquet in London. He had attained
high distinction as a lawyer and achieved great
prominence in public life in the United States when, in
1899, President McKinley appointed him ambassador to
Great Britain. There he became a &ldquo;messenger of good-will&rdquo;
in a very marked degree.</p>
<p>The scholarly orator, arising to speak, confessed that
he was resigning because he was homesick. Then he explained:
&ldquo;My friends on this side of the water are
multiplying every day in numbers and increasing in the
ardor of their affection. I am sorry to say that the great
host of my friends on the other side are as rapidly
diminishing and dwindling away:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Part of his host have crossed the flood,</p>
<p class="t">And part are crossing now;&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and I have a great desire to be with the waning number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an effective use of words from a great hymn
which Mr. Choate, a Harvard graduate, evidently well
knew. The incident has been preserved for us by the Rev.
John Telford. They came from the hymn of Charles Wesley,
which begins:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, let us join our friends above</p>
<p class="t">Who have obtained the prize.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This was the hymn that John Wesley and his congregation
in Staffordshire were singing at the hour when
Charles Wesley, its author, joined the company in heaven.
Once, when in Dublin, John Wesley announced this hymn,
and making some comments on the same affirmed that it
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
was &ldquo;the sweetest hymn&rdquo; his brother ever wrote. That
lover and critic of hymns, W. T. Stead, reports that the
Bishop of Hereford wrote him that he thought that the
fourth verse &ldquo;was one of the finest in the whole realm of
hymnology.&rdquo; This runs:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;One army of the living God,</p>
<p class="t">To His command we bow:</p>
<p class="t0">Part of his host have crossed the flood,</p>
<p class="t">And part are crossing now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Students in the classes of the beloved Samuel F. Upham,
professor in Drew Theological Seminary, will readily
recall how he, in advancing age, with characteristic fervor
and deep emotion, occasionally quoted the third and
fourth lines of this cherished verse. Stevenson, in his informing
discussion of the Wesley hymns, has given us a
great variety of incidents associated with this song, and
refers to it as &ldquo;that great and impassioned hymn.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c34">His Ordination Hymn</h3>
<p>The day of his ordination is a sacred one in the life of
a minister. It marks the time when he is definitely set
apart for a very sacred task for the balance of his life.
Therefore the events of that day are deeply embedded in
the life of the individual who is henceforth to proclaim
the gospel.</p>
<p>Reference was made by Dr. William Pierson Merrill,
then pastor of the Brick Presbyterian Church in New
York City, on October 26, 1930, when the fortieth anniversary
of his own ordination was observed, to the special
hymn which was sung on that occasion. Written by the
scholarly Dr. Timothy Dwight, it has held a secure place
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
in the hymnology of the Christian Church. The words
deeply impressed him as a young man when they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I love Thy kingdom, Lord,</p>
<p class="t">The house of Thine abode,</p>
<p class="t0">The Church our blest Redeemer saved</p>
<p class="t">With His own precious blood.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Speaking of what the hymn had meant to him through
the years of his pulpit and pastoral experience, he said:
&ldquo;I believed then, I am far surer now, that this is the attitude
for every Christian, and everyone who would do
his best for the common good. You cannot afford to
neglect <i>the church</i>.&rdquo; Then once more the hymn was sung.</p>
<p>Deep in the affections of thousands of Christians there
dwells this love for the church of the living Christ. Therefore
through the decades since this hymn was written
Christians have assembled in their various places of worship,
and have meaningly and happily sung:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For her my tears shall fall;</p>
<p class="t">For her my prayers ascend;</p>
<p class="t0">To her my cares and toils be given;</p>
<p class="t">Till toils and cares shall end.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c35">Soldiers Sang at Their General&rsquo;s Funeral</h3>
<p>The great military leader who had a premonition that
he would die in battle came to his death as the result of
an accident sustained soon after the close of World War
II. Generals and colonels were the pall bearers of General
George S. Patton, Jr., when he was laid to rest on Christmas
eve, 1945, in the American Military Cemetery near
Luxembourg. Six hundred men who had served under
General Patton in combat formed an honor guard; and
his grave &ldquo;was no different from six thousand others
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
which marked the resting-place of soldiers from his own
beloved Third Army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funeral services were held in Christ Church, Heidelberg,
Germany, on December 23rd, and those were extensively
reported for the Associated Press. Two army
chaplains were in charge. Mrs. Patton, who sat in the
front of the church, &ldquo;turned her head to look at the choir
loft when a soldier choir of thirty-six voices&rdquo; began to
sing the first hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The strife is o&rsquo;er, the battle done;</p>
<p class="t0">The victory of life is won;</p>
<p class="t0">The song of triumph has begun.</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of those Easter hymns which is included
in almost every hymnal, but which is actually used
much less than it deserves,&rdquo; remarks Dr. Charles A. Boyd.
Tersely he adds: &ldquo;It is a historic treasure, one of those
Latin hymns so old that nobody knows the exact age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the choral group from the Seventh Army began
to sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Son of God goes forth to war,</p>
<p class="t">A kingly crown to gain;</p>
<p class="t0">His blood-red banner streams afar:</p>
<p class="t">Who follows in His train?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the khaki-clad officers and men who filled Christ Church,
where the Episcopal service was conducted, joined in singing
the familiar hymn. Onward to its concluding lines they
sang with mighty voice:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A glorious band, the chosen few</p>
<p class="t">On whom the Spirit came,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p class="t0">Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,</p>
<p class="t">And mocked the cross and flame;</p>
<p class="t0">They climbed the steep ascent of heaven</p>
<p class="t">Through peril, toil, and pain:</p>
<p class="t0">O God, to us may grace be given</p>
<p class="t">To follow in their train!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The comment of Dr. Charles S. Robinson concerning
this hymn merits consideration: &ldquo;This is one of Bishop
Reginald Heber&rsquo;s finest lyrics, ranking in the estimation
of many with that anthem-like composition, &lsquo;Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God Almighty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two hymns mentioned were sung at the request of
Mrs. Patton, who stated that these were the two hymns
which her husband most loved.</p>
<p>The soldiers lifted the flag from the casket, &ldquo;and held
it a few inches&rdquo; above the lid when the burial service
occurred at Luxembourg. The 63rd Psalm (General Patton&rsquo;s
favorite passage of Scripture) was intoned by
Chaplain Edwin R. Carter. The military men bared their
heads, and the service closed with the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.
&ldquo;With the ending of the prayer, the soldiers folded the
flag and handed it to Mrs. Patton.... A bugle sounded
taps for the fallen leader.... The Russian, British and
French generals, their great coats gleaming with medals,
held themselves strictly in salute until Mrs. Patton turned
to leave.&rdquo; The body of the American general was now
resting beside that of an American private.</p>
<p>Details will gradually be forgotten by those who witnessed
them, or followed the reports in the daily newspapers;
but Americans will love to recall the favorite
hymns of a beloved military leader who participated in a
most significant manner in the events of World War II.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">HYMNS THAT CHANGED LIVES</span></h2>
<p>Twice it has been my privilege to go to the Fiji Islands,
the second time just passing through on the ship. I never
forgot the things told me on my first visit. A hundred
years ago all over the island of Tonga the people were
cannibals, but I saw Christian schools and colleges, in one
of which I addressed 400 girls, from 13 to 19 years of
age, who worked up to matriculation standard. When I
had finished speaking they sang to me a Fijian farewell
song. Then I saw these 400 big girls in their blue tunics
scampering over the green, skin ebony black, teeth ivory
white. Their parents were all slaves; their grandparents
cannibals, but these girls burst into spontaneous singing
and the words they sang were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What a wonderful change in my life has been made,</p>
<p class="t0">Since Jesus came into my heart!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lr">&mdash;<i>Rev. Norman Dunning, at the Sudan Interior Mission.</i></p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;<i>The Christian Herald, London.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Presiding at a great meeting in City Road Chapel,
London, in 1933, when the object was to inform the audience
what was being done among the men of the army,
the navy, and the air force by the churches, Mr. Joseph
Rank opened by giving his own experience. One Sunday
evening he went to hear the famous and eloquent Hugh
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
Price Hughes, who long conducted a successful mission
in London. Before he began to preach, the company sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the promise of God, full salvation to give</p>
<p class="t0">Unto him who on Jesus, His son, will believe.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;Hallelujah, &rsquo;tis done! I believe on the Son;</p>
<p class="t">I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;While singing it with the rest,&rdquo; said Mr. Rank, &ldquo;the
question came to me, &lsquo;Can you truthfully say that?&rsquo; By
the time we came to the chorus again, I had the peace
that passeth understanding. I had the same warmed heart
that John Wesley got, that Luther got, and that thousands
of others got in the same way, through believing in Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c37">When Catherine Booth Made the Great Decision</h3>
<p>A Salvation Army Band led the singing and a Salvation
Army officer delivered the address at one of the three
meetings held in connection with the 150th anniversary
of Stockwell Green Congregational Church, London, during
the summer of 1946. Very special reasons lay back of
the recognition of the Salvation Army on that occasion,
for in that church the wife of General William Booth
made the &ldquo;great decision&rdquo;; and in front of the speaker
was the pew bearing the number 23 where Catherine
Mumford always sat with her family. She was also a
teacher in its Sunday School. In that church on one June
day she was converted, and on another June day she was
married to the Rev. William Booth, a young Methodist
minister. The future years led these two young people,
one a Congregationalist and the other a Methodist, in
paths of Christian service beyond their utmost dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Catherine had a gloriously happy memory in the hymn
which led to her conversion, and rejoiced in its emphatic
assurance, as expressed by Charles Wesley:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;My God, I am Thine;</p>
<p class="t">What a comfort divine,</p>
<p class="t0">What a blessing to know that my Jesus is mine!</p>
<p class="t">In the heavenly lamb</p>
<p class="t">Thrice happy I am,</p>
<p class="t0">And my heart it doth dance at the sound of His name.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn has always been popular in British Methodism,
and in the latest edition of their hymn-book
(1933) it is set to the tune of <i>Harwich</i>. Telford characterized
it as &ldquo;a hymn with an extraordinary history
of blessing ever since it was written.&rdquo; One can easily
imagine, therefore, with what delight the young convert
could henceforth sing the second verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;True pleasures abound</p>
<p class="t">In the rapturous sound;</p>
<p class="t0">And whoever hath found it hath paradise found.</p>
<p class="t">My Jesus to know,</p>
<p class="t">And to feel His blood flow,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis life everlasting, &rsquo;tis heaven below.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c38">His Song and Experience in a Coal Mine</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest English poet of his age,&rdquo; said Dr. James
Moffatt when speaking of William Cowper. But this same
writer gave us some of our most cherished hymns. They
are greatly beloved in our American churches as well as
in his native land. Among those richly cherished and
frequently used in worship is the one which deals with
Divine Providence:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;God moves in a mysterious way</p>
<p class="t">His wonders to perform.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>This hymn &ldquo;has helped multitudes to bear up under the
blows of apparently adverse fortune,&rdquo; we are told by W.
T. Stead. Referring to the verse which reads:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;</p>
<p class="t">The clouds ye so much dread</p>
<p class="t0">Are big with mercy, and shall break</p>
<p class="t">In blessings on your head,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>we are told that &ldquo;It has been much used in times of
danger and distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In confirmation of this statement, we have the experience
of the Rev. Eric Kinworthy, Rotherham, England.
This personal incident won first prize among six hundred
hymn stories submitted to <i>The Methodist Recorder</i>, London,
in a &ldquo;Readers&rsquo; Christmastide Symposium,&rdquo; December,
1946. We give the story in the words of Mr. Kinworthy,
who indicated the effect it had on his life:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a boy in my &rsquo;teens my work was that of a pony-driver
in the local coal-mine, and being a lover of horses,
my work-mate and I were on good terms. Usually we were
kept very busy, for two ponies and their drivers were
needed to keep the colliers supplied with empty tubs, and
to take away the full tubs from the coal-face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One afternoon, since but few of the men were at work,
Captain, my pony, was well able to do the work by himself.
The other pony was allowed to stay in the stables.
As we went on our way to the end of the level with a
full load, I was singing a hymn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, there was an awful crash. We were jerked
to a standstill. It was impossible to see anything until the
dust cleared. In a little while, I found the roof had caved
in, and resting on top of the first two tubs was a huge
stone weighing about two hundredweights. Other big
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
stones were lying around. I was badly frightened, but
realized my life had been wonderfully spared from death
or certain injury. If the pony had not increased his pace
a moment or two before, nothing could have saved us. I
had been singing a moment before&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;God moves in a mysterious way.</p>
<p class="t0">His wonders to perform.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Immediately I knelt in the dust and dedicated my life to
God. He had spared me for some high purpose. Today I
am trying to fit in, in that great purpose, as a minister.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c39">Decision of the &ldquo;Incorrigible&rdquo;</h3>
<p>One of the great hymns of the twentieth century, and
one which attained immediate popularity, the author tells
us, was &ldquo;written for a Consecration Service at Boston
University School of Religious Education in 1926.&rdquo; The
opening lines begin with a striking question and a significant
answer:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Are ye able,&rsquo; said the Master,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;To be crucified with me?&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; the sturdy dreamers answered,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;To the death we Follow Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Many interesting stories have gathered around this
hymn, written by Professor Earl Marlatt, then of the
Boston University School of Theology. Among these
stories, which he treasures, was one given to me by
Professor Marlatt, with full permission to use the same.
Therefore I give it in his own words: &ldquo;One of my former
students, serving as a chaplain in Sherborn Prison for
Women, wrote me a letter to say that she had used this
hymn in a Sunday vesper service at the prison. Two hours
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
later she was called to the cell of one of the so-called
&lsquo;incorrigibles.&rsquo; The girl was very quiet now and soft-spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose you were surprised to have me call for
you,&rsquo; she said to the chaplain, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t wonder. I&rsquo;ve
never done much with religion. If I had I wouldn&rsquo;t be
here, probably. That song we sang tonight made me see
what the things you believe can mean to people like me.
Please tell your friend, that he&rsquo;s never seen me, but he
wrote that second verse for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She repeated the second verse from memory:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Are ye able to remember,</p>
<p class="t">When a thief lifts up his eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">That his pardoned soul is worthy</p>
<p class="t">Of a place in Paradise?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just thank him, please, and tell him I&rsquo;ll try to remember
and be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few hymns have so captured young people as this one,
and they love to sing it. The refrain, especially, makes an
appeal to them, and with glowing radiance on their faces
they happily sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Lord, we are able&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t">Our spirits are Thine,</p>
<p class="t0">Remold them, make us,</p>
<p class="t">Like Thee, divine.</p>
<p class="t0">Thy guiding radiance</p>
<p class="t">Above us shall be</p>
<p class="t0">A beacon to God,</p>
<p class="t">To love and loyalty.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c40">The Hymn That Wrought a Miracle</h3>
<p>The Wembley Stadium is known as a great sports center
in England. With it, however, there is associated a very
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
remarkable story of the effect of one of our choicest
hymns. English periodicals have reported this incident
under the headings of &ldquo;The Miracle at Wembley&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Song in the Stadium.&rdquo; Naturally the story is associated
with an individual, who in this case is Mr. T. P.
Ratcliffe, &ldquo;the conductor in tennis flannels,&rdquo; and dates
back to a &ldquo;memorable day at the Wembley Stadium, in
April, 1927, when the crowd numbered 96,000 people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Refusing to be discouraged by the statements of his
friends, that &ldquo;singing at Wembley would not be a success,&rdquo;
this leader of community singing had his great
audience begin with &ldquo;Pack Up Your Troubles,&rdquo; and followed
with other popular songs of the day. The people
liked it. Said he: &ldquo;On my right, 48,000 waved their
song-sheets and shouted &lsquo;Cheerio&rsquo; to a similar number on
my left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This period of singing was about to close, when, greatly
daring, the leader announced that they would, in conclusion,
sing the &ldquo;grand old hymn, &lsquo;Abide With Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; He
was about to ask all to stand, when, glancing at the Royal
box, he saw King George V rise and bare his head.</p>
<p>The hymn created a great depth of religious feeling.
Said the leader, as quoted in <i>The British Weekly</i>: &ldquo;Wembley
became for the moment a great open air cathedral.&rdquo;
One who knew the circumstances remarked: &ldquo;If ever any
felt a possible incongruity in the singing of &lsquo;Abide With
Me&rsquo; by almost 100,000 people on a football ground and
in between two exciting parts of a game that awakened
an immense sporting enthusiasm they should listen to
some of the stories of the influence of that hymn under
those conditions.&rdquo; One of those related was particularly
arresting.</p>
<p>This concerned a man who was in a muddled condition
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
because of drink, but the strange experience of &ldquo;singing
a church hymn on a football stand apparently sobered
him.&rdquo; And an usher stated that he pulled off his cap for
the final stanza.</p>
<p>Two years later Mr. Ratcliffe, the leader, was singing in
a mission hall in the north of England, and a lady who
was present asked him to her home to visit her husband.
When he reached the house her husband, Bill, with shining
eyes, grasped the visitor&rsquo;s hand, and expressed his
happiness. He was the confused Wembley singer, and he
thus related what happened to him: &ldquo;When you sang
&lsquo;Abide With Me&rsquo; something snapped. I could never explain,
but I felt myself a new man. The singing of the
first verse recalled my Christian parents, and a godly
home, while the second brought before me my unhappy
wife and children. I tried to join in the third verse which
was a prayer just suited to me.&rdquo; This is the verse which
begins:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I need Thy presence every passing hour:</p>
<p class="t0">What but Thy grace can foil the tempter&rsquo;s power?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s wife then explained how she was affected as she
took the visitor to the window, and told how she was
waiting Bill&rsquo;s return. She expected that when she saw him
he would be &ldquo;in his usual state.&rdquo; But as he turned the
corner he was running and singing, and when he entered
the house he kissed her, and, between sobs, told her what
had happened.</p>
<p>Later years have found him in the home three times,
said this visitor in the latter part of 1945. The three children
were taught to call him &ldquo;Uncle Tom.&rdquo; Each time
he visited the family the little girl got the large Bible
and read one of the miracles of Jesus. Then the father
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
would put an arm around the group of children and
narrate the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; that happened to him at Wembley
&ldquo;when the football crowd sang &lsquo;Abide With Me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uncle Tom&rdquo; would then sing the hymn that caused the
miracle.</p>

<h2 id="c41"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SONGS OF CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One Sunday evening a farmer was teaching his little girl the
hymn, &lsquo;A charge to keep I have.&rsquo; When they came to the verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;To serve the present age,</p>
<p class="t">My calling to fulfill;</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, may it all my powers engage</p>
<p class="t">To do my Master&rsquo;s will!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the godly father told his daughter that the Creator had brought
her into the world that she might fulfill that verse. The child
believed it. And because that verse took possession of that little
girl and started her on a great career, Frances E. Willard stands
in perpetual marble in Statuary Hall in the Capitol at Washington,
the one woman in the nation&rsquo;s Hall of Fame.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Homiletic
Review.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little lad, according to the story related by Bishop
William Burt, loved to sing. He had a particular fondness
for one hymn, and hence he often sang around the
home the hymn which he had learned in Sunday School:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul,</p>
<p class="t">Let me to Thy bosom fly.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The parents, naturally, were delighted to have their
growing boy displaying his gift of song; but he sometimes
sang at what appeared to them to be inopportune
moments. For instance, one night the family were going to
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
a party, and the little fellow was warned not to sing on
that occasion.</p>
<p>During the evening, however, the boy was in a corner
of the room, and, being alone, began to sing his beloved
hymn in a clear, sweet voice. Those present were delighted
at the pleasing incident. When, however, the boy observed
his parents look at him, somewhat reprovingly, he said
to them, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it, but it sang itself.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c42">Song of the Child in the Shelter</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mummie, do you think they would listen if I sang for
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not,&rdquo; was the mother&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t sing here,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Mother and her little girl were in an English air raid
shelter and the wartime experience was a new one for
the perplexed child. England was being terribly bombed
in the spring of 1941, and on this occasion more than a
hundred people, highly nervous, were trying to meet their
fears with loud conversation, shouting, laughter, and
some kind of singing. The scene of commotion distressed
the little girl, and she wished the people were less noisy.
A British writer told us what happened.</p>
<p>The conversation of mother and daughter was overheard
by a woman who was sitting near by. Turning to
the mother the woman said, &ldquo;And why should she not
sing?&rdquo; Immediately, therefore, she stood up, called for
order, and invited the little girl to sing.</p>
<p>The child, very shyly, advanced to the middle of the
shelter, and clasped her hands, as though in prayer. Lifting
her sweet childish voice she sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me;</p>
<p class="t">Bless Thy little lamb tonight;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p class="t0">Through the darkness be Thou near me;</p>
<p class="t">Keep me safe till morning light.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All this day Thy hand has led me,</p>
<p class="t">And I thank Thee for Thy care;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;</p>
<p class="t">Listen to my evening prayer.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let my sins be all forgiven;</p>
<p class="t">Bless the friends I love so well;</p>
<p class="t0">Take me when I die to heaven,</p>
<p class="t">Happy there with Thee to dwell.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Silence immediately prevailed. Hearts which were unmoved
by the confusion of the earlier noises were touched
by the song of the child. Their spirits became responsive,
for a little child had led them in a song which was both
a prayer of thanksgiving and reverent petition. Mary
Lundie Duncan, who was the daughter of one minister
and the wife of another, wrote this hymn, as she did
others, for her own children. &ldquo;In every word it breathes
the childlike spirit.&rdquo; Dr. James Moffatt, speaking perhaps
more for his native country than for America (though
the hymn is found in the section for children in some of
our American hymnals), said that this is &ldquo;the first evening
prayer that thousands of little children learn.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c43">What the Scouts Sang</h3>
<p>Sea Scouts accompanied Boy Scouts to a morning service
of worship on a February Sunday, 1947, and thus &ldquo;gave
modern color to the old-world dignity&rdquo; of a very beautiful
Presbyterian Church in an American city. It was also
the first Sunday in his new pastorate of a man who had
served during World War II with anti-aircraft units in
the Southwest Pacific. Thus everything combined to make
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
the occasion memorable. Said the minister to the Scouts:
&ldquo;In my work as chaplain I found it was boys with Scout
background who stepped forward and offered to be of
service. And a marked proportion of distinguished service
medals were awarded to former scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;sermon found its devotional climax,&rdquo; we were
told, &ldquo;in the hymn of consecration&rdquo; selected to be sung.
This was written by a great lover of youth, the Rev.
Charles A. Dickinson, D.D. Born in Vermont, July 4,
1849, he graduated from Harvard University. In the latter
part of his life he established his residence in California.
The hymn sung was:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Blessed Master, I have promised,</p>
<p class="t">Hear my solemn vow;</p>
<p class="t0">Take this pledge of mine and seal it</p>
<p class="t">Here and now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The outstanding characteristic of this hymn is the
absolute finality of the solemn dedication to Christ. It is
&lsquo;here and now&rsquo; that the irrevocable decision is made,&rdquo;
commented Covert and Laufer. But the hymn closes with
a prayer for strength to keep the pledge made:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let no worldly cares or pleasures</p>
<p class="t">Call my heart away;</p>
<p class="t0">Save me, Lord, and keep me faithful</p>
<p class="t">Day by day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hearts have been deeply stirred by the use of this
hymn at the monthly consecration service of Christian Endeavor
societies, for which it was evidently designed,&rdquo; we
are told. It was a good hymn for the Scouts to sing on
that winter morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h3 id="c44">&ldquo;Jesus Bids Us Shine&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This large family lived about equi-distant from four
towns on a quiet inaccessible rented farm along the river.
It was while I was visiting the country school that I first
got acquainted with some of the children. They told me
about their youngest sister, who had had infantile paralysis.
After getting rather minute directions from the older
brother, I finally found the isolated farm home.</p>
<p>Alice was five years old and as bright and as ardent a
little child as I ever knew. She was very easy to make
friends with and I soon began to teach her the first verse
of the children&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Jesus Bids Us Shine.&rdquo; When I
came to the line, &ldquo;You in your small corner, and I in
mine,&rdquo; I would point first at her and then at myself. She
got a great &ldquo;kick&rdquo; out of this and set herself to learn
the words and the tune. I visited with the older folks a
while, went out to the barn with the farmer to look at
his stock, ate dinner with the family, but in between times
I kept trying to teach little Alice the first verse of that
song. Finally she could sing it with the assistance of her
older sister.</p>
<p>About a year later I went out to the Anderson home but
found that Alice had been taken for treatment to the
children&rsquo;s hospital at the University. I went back a year
later, and this time I found that an ambulance had come
after her that very morning. Perhaps six months later, I
was again slowly taking the deeply-rutted road. She came
limping toward me as fast as she could, which was not
very fast. Hobbling down the lane on her one good leg
with the aid of a considerably improved other leg, she
called out to me with ardent pride, &ldquo;I can sing that song.
<i>I can sing that song!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she could:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus bids us shine, with a clear pure light,</p>
<p class="t">Like a little candle burning in the night;</p>
<p class="t0">In this world of darkness, we must shine,</p>
<p class="t">You in your small corner, and I in mine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t forget to point at me either!</p>
<div class="verse">

<h3 id="c45">Men Loved the Kiddies&rsquo; Hymn</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen an officer in mid-years almost break down
in tears because I casually quoted the ... hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Now the day is over,</p>
<p class="t">Night is drawing nigh;</p>
<p class="t0">Shadows of the evening</p>
<p class="t">Steal across the sky.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Such was the testimony of Chaplain Thomas Tiplady,
who was with the British forces in France during World
War I. He gives the reason for this when he says that
the man&rsquo;s mother had for several years repeated the hymn
to him every evening.</p>
<p>But most of the soldiers liked this hymn. Particularly
impressive is the account given of the time when the men
assembled for worship in a little church at Achicourt,
about a mile out of Arras. There the men often gathered,
even though the building had been badly shattered. A
final service was held, and the benediction had been
pronounced. Then the chaplain said: &ldquo;Before we part
and before we leave Achicourt which has meant so much
to us of joy and sorrow, let us sing a kiddies&rsquo; hymn.&rdquo; It
was not in their books, but the leader read it verse by
verse, and the men sang. One may easily imagine their
deep feelings as they united in the words:</p>

<p>In the rude mining camp, cut off by the snows of winter,
in the narrow cabin of the ship ice-bound in the
Arctic seas, in the bare, dark rooms of the war-prison
where the captive soldiers are trying to beguile the heavy
time in company, tears steal down the rough cheeks when
some one strikes up the familiar notes of &ldquo;Home, Sweet

<h3 id="c47">Chinese and Americans Sang a Negro Spiritual</h3>
<p>The distinguished Negro musician who was the guest
of honor of The Hymn Society of America at its spring
meeting, in 1944, was Dr. Harry T. Burleigh, who had
then been associated for half a century with the music
of St. George&rsquo;s Church, New York City. This prominent
man began by tracing his love of music to his mother, and
also his blind grandfather, who taught him many, many
of the old Negro melodies when a lad. Then, perseveringly,
he won a scholarship at the National Conservatory
of Music in New York.</p>
<p>After relating how much of his time had been devoted
to the task of arranging and composing Negro spirituals
he sat at the piano and thrilled his audience as he sang
these beautiful songs: &ldquo;Weeping Mary,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go Down in
the Lonesome Valley to Meet Your Saviour There,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Seeking for a City, Hallelujah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, I Want to be a
Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily there was present that day the Rev. Timothy
Tingfang Lew, professor at Yengching University,
Chengtu, West China. He narrated how there was produced
in China a common hymnal for the leading evangelical
churches, and stated that &ldquo;the present Chinese
hymnbook, &lsquo;Hymns of Universal Praise,&rsquo; was the result
of effective team-work.&rdquo; Included in this book was, he
indicated, &ldquo;Lord, I Want to Be a Christian,&rdquo; and suggested
that they all sing it with Dr. Burleigh. Everybody
liked the idea.</p>
<p>Two Chinese missionaries were accompanying Dr. and
Mrs. Lew; so these four sang it in the Chinese language,
while the others sang in English. Thus their voices blended
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
in one of the beloved spirituals of the Negro race, while
they were accompanied by a Negro on the piano.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lord, I want to be a Christian,</p>
<p class="t">In-a my heart, in-a my heart</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, I want to be a Christian</p>
<p class="t">In-a my heart.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Writers of hymns, composers of tunes, church organists
and choir leaders were in that company of men and
women who joyfully sang the verses of that beloved spiritual,
and their faces were radiant as they came to the
words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lord, I want to be like Jesus</p>
<p class="t">In-a my heart, in-a my heart,</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, I want to be like Jesus</p>
<p class="t">In-a my heart.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The entire company felt and affirmed that the effect
was most touching.</p>
<p>When the United States entered World War II five
leaders of the Salvation Army, who knew what American
youth liked to sing, and what is also profitable for them,
made a small selection of hymns for the use of the armed
forces in both their religious services and social gatherings.
That thin little book wisely contained the appealing
spiritual:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lord, I want to be a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus it went around the world with our American lads.
The people of Great Britain, the newspapers affirmed,
became greatly attached to it, and particularly enjoyed
hearing it sung by the colored soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h3 id="c48">Christmas Carols in Two Tongues</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It required an attentive ear to notice that the singing
was in two languages at once,&rdquo; said a reporter in <i>The
New York Times</i> when he gave a vivid description of the
Christmas service conducted in the First Chinese Church
in New York City on the Sunday following Christmas
Day, in 1946. Children took a very prominent part, especially
in the rendering of Christmas music.</p>
<p>The building was decorated in the traditional fashion.
Both the United States flag and that of the Chinese were
displayed, and between them was a white banner with
&ldquo;red cut-out characters saying &lsquo;Merry Christmas&rsquo; in
Chinese.&rdquo; Various Christmas exercises were rendered, and
then a speaker emphasized the fact that Christmas belongs
to everybody.</p>
<p>Together they sang, &ldquo;The First Noel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hark!
the Herald Angels Sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the service closed the &ldquo;two stars of the program,
small brothers,&rdquo; sang the lovely hymn attributed
to Martin Luther:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,</p>
<p class="t0">The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.</p>
<p class="t0">The stars in the sky looked down where He lay,</p>
<p class="t0">The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a big day for these Chinese children and their
parents,&rdquo; commented the reporter. For many visitors, also,
it was a time of happiness. The joyful strains of Christmas
music make human hearts glad wherever the story
of the Christ Child is told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h3 id="c49">&ldquo;Everybody Knows &lsquo;Holy Night&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Can we not sing something together?&rdquo; This was the
question asked in the days of the First World War at a
gathering in the Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association in
Boston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; someone exclaimed, &ldquo;how can we?&rdquo; Then
she added, &ldquo;There is no language which all of us speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer appeared to be discouragingly decisive until
a French girl made a happy suggestion. &ldquo;But tunes,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;are the same, and there ought to be a tune which
we all know, even if we have to sing different words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows &lsquo;Holy Night,&rsquo;&rdquo; remarked a young
woman of large musical ability, born in Russia. Her parentage
was English and German, and she had cousins in
each of the three nations. She sat down at the piano and
began to play the song.</p>
<p>An American concert singer with a rare voice, invited
in for the occasion, stood by her and led. Those who spoke
English began to sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Silent night, holy night,</p>
<p class="t0">All is calm, all is bright.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One after another others joined, and soon, French,
Swiss, German, Austrian, Belgian, Pole, Russian and
Italian were all singing together the same message to the
same music&mdash;but each in her own tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we all start from Christ,&rdquo; said Henry Churchill
King, who once related this incident, &ldquo;the nations can
come into harmony, even though each sings in its own
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h3 id="c50">Unifying Influence of Song at Eastertide</h3>
<p>The spirit of Easter has an exhilarating effect on all
peoples in Christian lands. The following from the news
columns of <i>The New York Times</i> on Easter Monday
(April 26, 1943) indicates that representatives of various
nationalities entered into the joy of the festive season.
Among the many services described that day was the sunrise
service at Central Park, as follows:</p>
<p>More than 6,000 persons gathered for the annual service
on the Mall in Central Park at 7 A.M. A group of Waves
and Spars and members of the Marine Corps Auxiliary
served as ushers. The services were principally musical,
with the singing of Easter hymns by various foreign-language
groups, as well as hymns in English.</p>
<p>The services were opened with the singing of &ldquo;The
Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; by Miss Lucy Monroe, accompanied
by the Maritime Band, and continued with the
singing of hymns by choirs from foreign-language
churches in the metropolitan area. Twelve Mohawk Indians
in tribal regalia, the choir of the Cuyler Presbyterian
Church, Brooklyn, sang &ldquo;Up From the Grave He Rose,&rdquo;
and a group of sixteen Chinese children sang the same
hymn in their native tongue.</p>
<p>The choir of the Russian Evangelical Pentecostal Church
sang the hymn, &ldquo;He Arose From the Dead,&rdquo; in Russian,
and &ldquo;He Lives&rdquo; was sung by an Italian choir led by the
Rev. D. Lisciandrello, pastor of Calvary Church, Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Other foreign language groups participating included
the Syrian Protestant Church, Brooklyn; the Spanish Christian
Church, and a Polish choir.</p>
<p>People of many lands, therefore, sang in their own
tongue the glad story of the resurrection of Christ.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">PATRIOTIC MUSIC IN WAR AND PEACE</span></h2>
<p>Soldier voices were heard singing in the crypt of St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral on July 4, 1941. Strangely, as though
protected by Divine Providence, this historic building was
still standing though surrounding London had been
destructively bombed and was mostly in ruins. But on that
memorable day there was unveiled a memorial tablet to
Billy Fiske, the first American to give his life in World
War II. Fliers from his own squadron and some other
American volunteers were the singers. &ldquo;Standing together
in the candle-lit dusk,&rdquo; said Alexander Woolcott, &ldquo;this
symbolic group of Anglo-American courage sang Billy
Fiske to his rest with the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A surprise awaited Mrs. F. D. Roosevelt on a September
day, in 1943, according to a report of the Associated
Press, when she walked into a room for youthful sufferers
from infantile paralysis in the Melbourne Child&rsquo;s Hospital.
Mrs. Roosevelt was in Australia at that time visiting
the American troops, but she was also interested in
these youthful patients.</p>
<p>There she saw, as she entered, &ldquo;Thirteen-year-old
Briar Dean holding a harmonica in his one usable hand,
and playing America&rsquo;s national anthem.&rdquo; When he halted
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
his music, Mrs. Roosevelt, attracted by the unusual scene,
walked directly to the youngster and asked him to play
for her. So he started over, and played through a verse,
and the chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four generals, one admiral, and numerous other gold-braided
men, stood at attention,&rdquo; according to the correspondent
who narrated the memorable event for his
American readers.</p>
<h3 id="c52">Surprise for American Soldiers</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Fourth of July in this joint British and
American Officers&rsquo; training camp,&rdquo; said an Associated
Press report from &ldquo;an officers&rsquo; training camp&rdquo; in North
Africa on July 5, 1943. No announcement, however, was
posted concerning a Fourth of July celebration. &ldquo;The
camp was to follow its regular routine. There would be
a route march at five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour of five came and the men fell in on the parade
ground, and started up the trail. It was observed that the
American general was making the march, but no British
officers were seen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our holiday, and they get the
day off. Can you beat it?&rdquo; Thus murmured the Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail led through a grove winding up and down
the slopes of the mountain,&rdquo; said the correspondent.
&ldquo;The sun was nearly down when they emerged into a
clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just ahead, in an open space among the trees, the
British officers were lined up in two files. They were singing
&lsquo;The Star-Spangled Banner.&rsquo; An American flag waved
above their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the tersely vivid account of a dramatic moment
in the lives of British and American soldiers in
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
North Africa during an important period in the history of
World War II.</p>
<h3 id="c53">&ldquo;America the Beautiful&rdquo; Heard at Arlington</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Unknown Soldier and his legions of sleeping
comrades were honored anew in this national cemetery
today&mdash;with fresh flowers and a solemn promise,&rdquo; said
an Associated Press report from the Arlington National
Cemetery on May 30, 1943. &ldquo;The Memorial Day crowd,&rdquo;
it added, &ldquo;came from every direction through the oak-shaded
walks of the cemetery, sobered by the sight of
fresh graves among the sod-covered resting places of
earlier veterans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taps were sounded by a marine corps bugler, and all
conversation ceased. President F. D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s wreath
was laid on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Representatives
of veterans&rsquo; organizations and their auxiliaries,
dressed in vivid uniforms, then deposited wreath after
wreath at the base of the white monument.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;solemn promise&rdquo; mentioned was given by
Lt.-Gen. Brehon B. Somervell who made this declaration:
&ldquo;To the nameless soldier here before us in this marble
tomb and through him to all his comrades, wherever they
may lie, we make this promise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With them we enter into an earnest covenant that
we will carry on the fight, against whatever odds and
however long it takes, until justice and decency and human
liberty are re-established throughout the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;America the Beautiful&rdquo; was distinctly heard as the
people moved quietly into the classic marble amphitheater,
as the carillon at Fort Myer, nearby, gave forth the music
of the beloved patriotic song of Katharine Lee Bates&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O beautiful for heroes proved</p>
<p class="t">In liberating strife,</p>
<p class="t0">Who more than self their country loved,</p>
<p class="t">And mercy more than life!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c54">An American Home on Invasion Day</h3>
<p>As a nation we had looked upon the war as a gigantic business
proposition which we could manage with our own resources:
production, government agencies, organization and training. Then
came D-Day, and for the first time we drew upon our reserve.</p>
<p>The first hour in the morning runs strictly to schedule in our
household since this is the only way to avoid confusion when the
children are getting ready for school as Dad leaves for the office.
As soon as I go downstairs, I turn the radio to the musical clock
program in order to check our progress.</p>
<p>Each morning a recording blares out, &ldquo;O, What a Beautiful
Morning!&rdquo; But on June 6 I heard an organ pealing forth &ldquo;Finlandia&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Be
still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side.&rdquo; And
then I knew before seeing the paper on the front porch that the
headline would be &ldquo;Invasion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each minute of this day was so filled with destiny that it
seemed of little importance to note their individual passing: so,
without the customary pause for announcing the time, the melody
changed to &ldquo;Onward, Christian Soldiers.&rdquo; Our boys were crossing
the channel in the presence of that other Son who had
suffered and died, that those he loved might live fully.</p>
<p>The muted organ almost whispered &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; as
parents knelt at home under the sheltering arms of that other
Father, whose heart had bled with each thrust of the spear. &ldquo;Let
me hide myself in Thee&rdquo; was the message. Those parents do not
care that it is a beautiful morning. It makes no difference that
the hands on the clock say that it is seven-fifteen. &ldquo;Simply to
Thy cross I cling&rdquo; was their solace.</p>
<p>And then the organ led in prayer, the prayer that filled the
hearts of the sons approaching the beachheads, and the parents in
their Gethsemane:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O God, our help in ages past,</p>
<p class="t0">Our hope for years to come,</p>
<p class="t0">Be thou our guide while life shall last,</p>
<p class="t0">And our eternal home!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>For the first time voices joined the melody of the organ.
Strong, confident, courageous voices ringing forth the affirmation,
&ldquo;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.&rdquo; And then the triumphant,
trumpet-like tones of the organ, sounding their notes of gratitude
to the &ldquo;God of our Fathers,&rdquo; whose strong arm is &ldquo;our
ever sure defense ... from war&rsquo;s alarms, from deadly pestilence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that moment, I murmured a prayer of gratitude that my
parents had taught me the words of these hymns so that my
thoughts had been led by the organ melodies to my personal
unlimited reserves, that represent the rightful heritage of a child
of God.</p>
<p>For my two children June 6, 1944, will soon have become another
date to learn from the pages of a history book. I cannot
know when their H-Hour will come. But I do know their reserves
will make them more than victorious because theirs is the greatest
inheritance in the universe&mdash;the &ldquo;Faith of our Fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;<i>Charlotte A. Young in &ldquo;The Christian Advocate,&rdquo; June 29, 1944. Used by permission.</i></span></p>
<h3 id="c55">&ldquo;Our God is Marching On!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The most solemn day in American history,&rdquo; was June
6, 1944, according to one editor. This was known as &ldquo;D
day,&rdquo; and was the day of the invasion of the coast of
Normandy by the Allied nations engaged in a mighty and
deadly struggle with Germany.</p>
<p>This day was anticipated for many weeks. It was known
that the United States and Great Britain would unite in
striking the enemy at a season and a place when and
where the blow would be considered to be most effective.
Only a few statesmen and high-ranking military authorities,
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
however, knew in advance just when that day would
come. One outstanding aim, of course, was to surprise the
enemy. A mighty military machine had been built for the
purpose; and, on the other hand, the enemy, in ignorance
of the secret of time and place, had done its utmost to mass
its forces and arrange its protective material where it was
hoped that they would be most effective.</p>
<p>Churches and communities arranged to ring their church
bells and give other signals as soon as the news of the
invasion was received, so that the people might learn of
the fateful hour and join in prayer. Churches also arranged
to open their buildings, and ministers planned for gatherings
for prayer. These features were generally observed.
Then at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, President F. D. Roosevelt,
who the previous evening addressed the nation on the fall
of Rome, led the nation in prayer. Probably never so many
people in the United States listened to the President at
the same time as on that occasion. &ldquo;In this poignant hour,
I ask you to join with me in prayer,&rdquo; said he to those,
who, all over the nation, were listening. Then he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day
have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve
our republic, our religion and our civilization, and to set
free a suffering humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead them straight and true; give strength to their
arms, stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prayer was inclusive, and men and women mostly
listened to it as they sat in their own homes&mdash;homes from
which their loved ones had gone forth to fight for freedom.
Then came the closing words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy will be done, Almighty God. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millions of eyes were moistened by tears at that hushed
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
moment. The pause was brief. Then from the radio came
voices reverently singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Onward, Christian soldiers,</p>
<p class="t">Marching as to war,</p>
<p class="t0">With the cross of Jesus</p>
<p class="t">Going on before!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Another selection was rendered, and then, most appropriately,
came the song of the beloved Julia Ward Howe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the
Lord,&rdquo; concerning which said one newspaper columnist
the next day, &ldquo;more than any other song of any time this
strikes deeply home at this hour.&rdquo; How impressive was
that refrain toward the close of this historic day:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Glory, glory, Hallelujah! Glory, glory, Hallelujah!</p>
<p class="t0">Glory, glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The second verse was rendered as a solo:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;</p>
<p class="t0">They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;</p>
<p class="t0">I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;</p>
<p class="t">His truth is marching on.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A male voice rendered one verse and a woman&rsquo;s voice
another. The chorus refrain was each time sung by the
entire chorus. Also, they all united in the closing verse.
How unforgettably impressive was this!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,</p>
<p class="t0">With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:</p>
<p class="t0">As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,</p>
<p class="t">While God is marching on.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h3 id="c56">&ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; at War&rsquo;s End</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a long war, and it is going to be a
tough war,&rdquo; said Franklin D. Roosevelt, when he appeared
before Congress on December 8, 1941, to ask for
a declaration of war with Japan after that nation had
attacked the United States. The President was speaking
that day in a prophetic strain. He was right. The war was
both &ldquo;long&rdquo; and &ldquo;tough.&rdquo; The wartime generation, of
World War II, will long remember the anxiety and sacrifice
of those days, as with grim determination our youth
fought and our people labored unitedly to win a priceless
victory. Not until September, 1945, did peace return to
our land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Stars and Stripes were raised over ancient Tokio
today as General MacArthur formally established authority
over Japan&rsquo;s battered capital in the name of the United
States,&rdquo; were the words which appeared on the front page
of some of our newspapers on September 8, 1945. This
account of what happened was printed in <i>The New York
Times</i>. It was written by Frank L. Kluckhorn: &ldquo;Standing
alone before Lt.-Gen. Robert Eichelberger, commander of
the 8th army, which is garrisoning Tokio, MacArthur
said: &lsquo;Gen. Eichelberger, have our country&rsquo;s flag unfurled,
and in Tokio&rsquo;s sun let it wave in its full glory as a symbol
of hope for the oppressed and as a harbinger of victory
for the right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eichelberger saluted, repeated the order, and the band
played the national anthem. As the guard of honor and
the others present saluted, the flag was raised on the pole
where it can be seen from much of Tokio. The chaplain
of the First Cavalry Division gave the benediction, and
the ceremony was over.&rdquo; But how thrilling and unforgettable
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
must it have been to have listened to the strains
of &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; in that momentous hour!</p>
<p>A news item observed that the American flag unfurled
on this occasion was the very flag that floated over the
Capitol in Washington on December 7, 1941. This was
the day when we were attacked by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Vauntingly the Japanese had declared, it was reported,
that peace terms would be signed in the White House in
Washington. Far different, however, was the reality. The
terms of the &ldquo;unconditional surrender&rdquo; of Japan were
made known, and the ceremonies relating to the signing
of the same were observed on board the battleship Missouri
in Tokio Bay. These were reported in the morning
papers of September 3, 1945, though millions of citizens
in the United States heard them over the radio the
previous night. We were told that the &ldquo;Missouri&rsquo;s band
outdid itself providing music, playing &lsquo;Anchors Aweigh&rsquo;
... and &lsquo;The Stars and Stripes Forever.&rsquo; A bugler
sounded &lsquo;Taps&rsquo; in memory of the gallant band of men
and women who had gone into the great conflict with
mighty forces with the hopeful feeling that</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;... conquer we must when our cause it is just,</p>
<p class="t0">And this be our motto, &lsquo;In God is our trust.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus the national anthem was played at the hour of
the formal surrender of Japan on the Missouri and also
when General MacArthur set up power in Tokio, &ldquo;and
the same historic flag was flown on both occasions.&rdquo; <i>The
Star-Spangled Banner</i> always has a special appeal when
it is rendered in the presence of the Stars and Stripes.
Our national anthem had gone with the nation from peace
to war and from war to peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the greatest single production of Rudyard
Kipling&rsquo;s pen,&rdquo; remarked Nutter and Tillett concerning
&ldquo;The Recessional.&rdquo; It is a hymn of majestic greatness,
and one can easily imagine the deep impression it must
have made when heard in Westminster Abbey on the day
when the body of the brilliant author was placed in that
historic shrine. The honor of being buried there, with the
great of the nation, was well deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Recessional&rdquo; was published in the <i>London Times</i>,
July 17, 1897; and it was written in celebration of the
Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The very next year
it appeared in a hymnal published by the American Baptist
Publication Society. Since then it has appeared in many
hymnals, and has frequently been sung on great patriotic
occasions.</p>
<p>Fortunately the author has told us how the hymn came
to be written. Said he: &ldquo;That poem gave me more trouble
than anything I ever wrote. I had promised the <i>Times</i>
a poem on the Jubilee; and when it became due, I had
written nothing that had satisfied me. The <i>Times</i> began
to want that poem badly and sent letter after letter asking
for it. I made many more attempts but no further
progress. Finally the <i>Times</i> began sending telegrams. So
I shut myself in a room with the determination to stay
there until I had written a Jubilee poem. Sitting down
with all my previous attempts before me, I searched
through those dozens of sketches till at last I found one
line I liked. That was &lsquo;Lest We Forget.&rsquo; Round these
words &lsquo;the Recessional&rsquo; was written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A majestic strain pervades the hymn. Its deep solemnity
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
reminds one of some of the language of the Old Testament
prophet. One thrills when he hears the lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;God of our fathers, known of old,</p>
<p class="t">Lord of our far-flung battle line,</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath whose awful hand we hold</p>
<p class="t">Dominion over palm and pine:</p>
<p class="t0">Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,</p>
<p class="t">Lest we forget, lest we forget!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The tumult and the shouting dies;</p>
<p class="t">The captains and the kings depart;</p>
<p class="t0">Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,</p>
<p class="t">A broken and a contrite heart:</p>
<p class="t0">Lord God of hosts, be with us yet,</p>
<p class="t">Lest we forget, lest we forget.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is interesting to read what Kipling&rsquo;s cousin, Miss
Florence Macdonald, wrote for <i>The Methodist Recorder</i>,
London, following Kipling&rsquo;s death. She said that she had
a letter that Kipling wrote to her father after &ldquo;The
Recessional&rdquo; was published. He there said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when one has three generations of Methody
(Methodist) ministers behind one, the pulpit streak is
bound to show. It&rsquo;s very funny to hear folk wondering
where I got it.&rdquo; Then Miss Macdonald made this observation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not generally known, perhaps, that he (Kipling)
was a grandson of the manse on both sides, his maternal
grandfather being the Rev. George B. Macdonald, and
his paternal grandfather being the Rev. Joseph Kipling,
both Wesleyan ministers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This side-light on Kipling&rsquo;s method of composition was
also given by Miss Macdonald: &ldquo;When composing verse
he would set it to a tune, often a hymn tune, and I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
heard him walking up and down the room singing a verse
over and over again to get the lilt and the swing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kipling, by the way, was awarded the Nobel prize for
literature in 1907. And when the author was laid to rest
in Westminster Abbey, June 23, 1936, the choir sang his
own &ldquo;Recessional,&rdquo; and through the venerable temple
there rang the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,</p>
<p class="t0">Lest we forget, lest we forget!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c58"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THANKSGIVING IN SONG</span></h2>
<p>The note of praise was sounded at the very beginning
of the 75th annual convention of the New York State
Council of Religious Education, which was held in Utica,
N. Y., October, 1930. The assembled delegates, whose
interest centered in directing the religious life of the
young people in the churches and communities of the
state, lifted up their voices in singing what was once
characterized by Dr. J. M. Buckley as the &ldquo;most perfect
hymn in thanksgiving in the English language:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For the beauty of the earth,</p>
<p class="t">For the glory of the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">For the love which from our birth</p>
<p class="t">Over and around us lies:</p>

<p class="t0">This our hymn of grateful praise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Each day in downtown Los Angeles, in the morning, at noonday,
and again at night, a mighty choir of bells invites the hearts
of merchants and bankers, tradesmen and newsboys, policemen
and seamstresses to pause and reflect, to be still a moment in
their hearts and receive the sacred benediction of the bells.</p>
<p>In the message of the bells there is joy and peace and love for
all our fellow men, the love one sometimes forgets in the hurly-burly
of a great city. Whenever I hear these bells I stop whatever
I am doing, and my heart looks up to the great tower atop a
lofty building and beyond to the vast blue sky.</p>
<p>My heart sings with the bells a prayer of gratitude for the
gentle reminder that commerce is not all.</p>

<h3 id="c59">Two Statesmen Sang &ldquo;America&rdquo; in Washington&rsquo;s Pew</h3>
<p>The American nation was called to supplication for
Divine guidance on the first day of 1942. The date was
historic, for the nation was entering on a New Year with
the dark shadows of war resting on the people. One of
the events of that day was recorded on the front page
of practically all our newspapers.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of Great Britain,
was at that time visiting the United States for the purpose
of conferring with President F. D. Roosevelt. The latter
took his guest with him to the quaint Episcopal Church
at Alexandria, Va., of which George Washington was,
in 1775, one of the founders. Together they occupied the
white pew in which Washington used to worship.</p>
<p>Each of the two statesmen loved to sing, hence both
of them united with the congregation when they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My country, &rsquo;tis of thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet land of liberty,</p>
<p class="t">Of thee I sing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps each responsible statesman, burdened with
anxiety, was thinking of his own country as he sang the
prayerful words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our fathers&rsquo; God, to Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Author of liberty,</p>
<p class="t">To Thee we sing;</p>
<p class="t0">Long may our land be bright</p>
<p class="t0">With freedom&rsquo;s holy light;</p>
<p class="t0">Protect us by Thy might,</p>
<p class="t">Great God, our King.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus did two statesmen of the twentieth century render
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
thanksgiving to God and covet his leadership and guidance
as they stood side by side and sang their faith in
God and country.</p>
<h3 id="c60">Gunner Led the Song of Praise</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances called for patient waiting,&rdquo; said one
who had been interned in the Allied-Prisoners-of-War
Camp &ldquo;on the west coast of the island of Honshu....
Over the mountains and two hundred miles to the south
the first atom bomb had been dropped during those
momentous days of August, 1945.... Then suddenly
everything was quiet. The wailing air-raid sirens, the heavy
drone of giant bombers, the explosions, the flames, the
panic and confusion ceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ending of hostilities ... gave place to long
silent and uneventful days, completely cut off from news
of the outside world.&rdquo; Thus ran the story of one who
signed himself with the initials &ldquo;R. E. W. H.&rdquo; as he narrated
some of his experiences in the Japanese prison camp
during World War II. The prison community consisted
of Australians, Americans, Dutch and British. Three and
a half years of alien bondage had been endured by some
of them.</p>
<p>One of the first concerted acts of these former prisoners,
when they definitely realized their freedom, was to hold
a service of thanksgiving. The account of this appeared
in <i>The British Weekly</i>, September 9, 1946. They had &ldquo;no
padre or religious leadership, but the desire to give praise
and thanks in a form of Divine service was spontaneous,
and embraced all sects and racial creeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first hymn used was a most appropriate selection:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Praise, my soul, the King of heaven,</p>
<p class="t">To His feet thy tribute bring;</p>
<p class="t0">Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,</p>
<p class="t">Evermore His praises sing;</p>
<p class="t0">Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t">Praise the Everlasting King!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>They did not get a good start. Perhaps they were overwhelmed
by their emotions. Eventually they followed the
lead &ldquo;of a confident and enthusiastic little gunner&rdquo;; and
as the company gained control of itself &ldquo;the hymn swelled
to strength, sung by Catholic, Anglican, Nonconformist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The service was methodical, having been planned with
care. It was held on the small parade ground in the
center of the camp. The table was covered by a worn but
well-washed strip of cloth. The crucifix was made by a
carpenter among the prisoners; and the Japanese, by request,
had supplied a small bowl of flowers. Benches were
taken from the huts of the prisoners, and served as seats.
The men had dressed for the occasion as best they could.
The writer who related the incident had been asked to
address them; and he found the assembled men most attentive.
The peace that came from the hymns and prayers
&ldquo;was reflected in their eyes and attitude.&rdquo; Those who
shared in worship will never forget that day. How feelingly
they must have sung that third verse!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Father-like, He tends and spares us;</p>
<p class="t">Well our feeble frame He knows:</p>
<p class="t0">In His hands He gently bears us,</p>
<p class="t">Rescues us from all our foes;</p>
<p class="t0">Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t">Widely yet His mercy flows.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h3 id="c61">Minister Thrilled by Singing of Philadelphia Laymen</h3>
<p>&ldquo;John Reith was reared in a Scottish manse on a diet
of porridge and prayer,&rdquo; but because of his useful service
to his native land he eventually became Sir John Reith.
During the first World War he visited the United States
as an inspector of war munitions, and in the interest of
national service. He had rendered service as Captain John
C. Reith, and had been wounded.</p>
<p>He was a notable figure as he moved through the
streets of Philadelphia, being 76 inches tall. The minister
who relates the following story often saw him as he
walked down Chestnut Street, for his &ldquo;great height and
commanding figure attracted all eyes.&rdquo; The Rev. John T.
Reeve, then a pastor of a Presbyterian Church in the city,
related the incident in 1941. Many prominent laymen of
the Presbyterian Churches of Philadelphia and vicinity
constituted the Social Union, and had a dinner once a
month. Occasionally ministers were invited.</p>
<p>Captain Reith was invited to address the Social Union
during his visit, and Dr. Reeve was a guest at that meeting.
The speaker indicated how much he missed the Bibles
from the pews in our American churches, and also made
reference to the ministry of his father. &ldquo;His talk moved
the audience deeply, and this young soldier made such
a spiritual impression on this company of several hundred
business and professional men as had seldom been felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Captain Reith ceased speaking the whole body
of men sprang to their feet. A prominent organist from
one of the churches went to the piano, and started to play.
His selection was:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The heavens declare Thy glory, Lord,</p>
<p class="t">In every star Thy wisdom shines;</p>
<p class="t0">But when our eyes behold Thy Word,</p>
<p class="t">We read Thy Name in fairer lines.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn of Isaac Watts was sung to the tune of
Uxbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such singing I never heard before or since,&rdquo; said Dr.
Reeve, as he recalled the event several years later. Then
he explained: &ldquo;In not many cities could this have taken
place. But in Philadelphia, where so many of these men
had been brought up in Covenanter and United Presbyterian
churches, they knew the great hymn. The thrills
ran up and down my back, and many times since in giving
out the hymn I have mentioned the incident, and shall
always remember Captain J. C. Reith with honor.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c62">&ldquo;We Love the Place&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;WE RETURN HOME!&rdquo; was the announcement which
appeared in some of the London papers in March, 1946.
This was followed by the statement that on Saturday
evening, March 9, at 6:30, there would be an act of
&ldquo;thanksgiving in song.&rdquo; This was a call to the congregation
of Central Hall, Westminster, London, who had been
dispossessed of the use of their building for the use of
the United Nations&rsquo; Conference.</p>
<p>The spacious Hall, the center of extensive social and
evangelistic work, was the place considered to be most
suitable for the gathering. Hence it was a strange sight
to see statesmen from many lands assemble day after day
in the place where the people were accustomed to hear the
minister, the Rev. Dr. W. E. Sangster, proclaim the message
of life everlasting to large congregations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have been on a strange pilgrimage,&rdquo; remarked
Dr. Sangster, as he faced his re-united people in their
own place of worship. During the previous four months
they had conducted their Sunday services in two different
theatres, and also the Carlton Hotel, all of which had
extended hospitality. Naturally, extensive preparations
were made for the joyful occasion. The great Wiseman
Choir, composed of singers from many religious centers
in London, and organized in memory of the beloved
musician and preacher, Dr. F. Luke Wiseman, sang; and
Dr. George F. Brockless was the leader of the singing
company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The choir obviously enjoyed themselves,&rdquo; said a reporter.
Famous musicians participated; and outstanding
musical selections were rendered, including the majestic
&ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody wanted to sing on this happy occasion. The
hymns needed to be selected with particular care. Beautifully
appropriate, therefore, was the first hymn of the
program:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We love the place, O God,</p>
<p class="t">Wherein Thine honor dwells;</p>
<p class="t0">The joy of Thine abode</p>
<p class="t">All earthly joy excels.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It is the house of prayer,</p>
<p class="t">Wherein Thy servants meet;</p>
<p class="t0">And Thou, O Lord, art there,</p>
<p class="t">Thy chosen flock to greet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn, which appeared in &ldquo;Hymns Ancient and
Modern,&rdquo; 1861, has found wide acceptance. It is found in
<i>The Church Hymnary</i> (Scotland); <i>The Hymnary</i> of the
United Church of Canada; and likewise <i>The Hymnal</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
(1940) of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United
States.</p>
<p>The author was the Rev. William Bullock, D.D. (1798-1874),
who was of English birth. Thirty-two years he
served as a minister for the Society of the Propagation of
the Gospel. Dr. James Moffatt tells us that this hymn,
based on Psalm 26:8, &ldquo;was composed in 1827 for the
dedication of a church in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland,
where he was rector.&rdquo; He also adds that &ldquo;seventy years
later, when a new building on the same site was dedicated,
this hymn was once more sung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his
courts with praise,&rdquo; said the Psalmist. It was in this spirit
that the congregation of the Central Hall, Westminster,
&ldquo;spent a memorable evening of thanksgiving.&rdquo; The hearts
of the people overflowed with joy as they ecstatically sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We love the place, O God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Prayerful were the lines which closed that hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lord Jesus, give us grace</p>
<p class="t">On earth to love Thee more,</p>
<p class="t0">In heaven to see Thy face,</p>
<p class="t">And with Thy saints adore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c63">Memorable Rendering of the Doxology</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the men will wish to sing and pray,&rdquo; said
the Rev. Dr. Oscar R. Maurer of New Haven, Conn.,
when he secured consent from the military authorities to
have the doors of the cathedral of Verdun opened when
the firing should cease at the end of World War I. The
dramatic story of the event was written for <i>Association
Men</i> by one who had been at work in France with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
Red Triangle. The scene was thus vividly described:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes of eleven, and still the guns roared on,
unmindful of the fact that peace was imminent. Five
minutes of eleven, and even the general and his aides
were showing signs of nervousness....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as suddenly as though God Himself had dropped
a wet blanket over the crackling flames of hell and at one
blow had extinguished them all, the firing and the rumbling
ceased. There was an instant&rsquo;s pause in which it
seemed as though the world had come to an end. Then
from the forty bells high in the still untouched towers
of that old cathedral at Verdun, which had witnessed the
most heroic sacrifice of life and love save that on Calvary
alone, pealed forth as did the voices over the Bethlehem
hills, those silver tones that once again were saying,
&lsquo;Peace on earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men began to leap wildly and joyously. They
shouted, sang and kissed one another. The cathedral doors
opened slowly, and about six hundred soldiers from the
armies of the Allies entered with a rush. Dr. Maurer
walked quietly to the altar rail, and there knelt in prayer.
Officers and privates alike reached for the swinging ropes,
and gave the bells another pull. The possibility that the
opportunity for a religious service was lost oppressed the
heart of Dr. Maurer with fear. The assembling company,
however, soon observed the lonely figure kneeling at the
altar, and they began to move forward. He rose, and all
was quiet. &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I believe we all want to
sing, and that we ought to sing the doxology.&rdquo; An English
soldier, with a splendid tenor voice, started the
familiar line:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Instantly all who knew the words joined in the glorious
doxology. Then the Americans, the English and the French
sang their respective national anthems before they reverently
left the building.</p>
<p>General Valentine, who had given consent for the
service to be held in the cathedral, went forward, took Dr.
Maurer&rsquo;s hands in his own, and said, &ldquo;I want to thank
you for leading these men on this occasion to offer praise
to God....&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c65">Christmas Carols on Deck of Battleship</h3>
<p>The battleship <i>Missouri</i> will always hold a unique place
in the history of the United States, for on her, at the
close of World War II, the Japanese made their formal
surrender. But about four months later (December 21,
1945) a very different scene was witnessed on her deck.
That night more than one hundred members of the Choral
Group of the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn
sang Christmas carols in sub-freezing weather. Naturally
the listening members of the appreciative crew recalled
the experiences of the previous Christmas, when they were
engaged in fighting World War II.</p>
<p>Beneath a string of 500-watt bulbs the chorus sang into
a microphone. Perhaps it was natural that they should
begin with the familiar and beloved carol written by
Bishop Phillip Brooks:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O little town of Bethlehem,</p>
<p class="t">How still we see thee lie!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Possibly some who listened made the words their heart
prayer as the singers rendered the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O holy Child of Bethlehem!</p>
<p class="t">Descend to us, we pray;</p>
<p class="t0">Cast out our sin, and enter in,</p>
<p class="t">Be born in us today!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Other carols were rendered, and then the singers concluded
with:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Silent night, holy night.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The songs of the glorious holiday season in a year that
began in war and ended in peace reminded the men of
home and family. One of the sailors remarked quietly to
another: &ldquo;I shall be home this Christmas for the first
time in four years.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c66">Christmastide Song of Blind Singers</h3>
<p>At the Christmas season before the second World War
a sale and entertainment were held in London under the
auspices of the Greater London Fund for the Blind.
Among the attractive features of the program during the
afternoon and the evening was the rendering of Christmas
carols by a company of blind singers. A London periodical,
commenting on this part of the program, said that it was
&ldquo;especially impressive&rdquo; when the chorus rendered the
peculiarly appropriate hymn of Bishop Reginald Heber:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,</p>
<p class="t"><i>Dawn on our darkness</i> and lend us Thine aid;</p>
<p class="t0">Star of the East, the horizon adorning,</p>
<p class="t">Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Blind though they were, the singers were conscious of
the fact that Christ was the &ldquo;Light of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hymn was first published in 1811. Several other
very popular hymns were written by the same author.
Following his training at Oxford University, he became
rector at Hodnet, and, later, Missionary Bishop of Calcutta,
where this &ldquo;man of learning and piety&rdquo; lived only
three years.</p>
<p>During this short period, however, he had the great
satisfaction of hearing this and another of his hymns
(&ldquo;The Son of God Goes Forth to War&rdquo;) sung better
than he &ldquo;had ever heard them sung in a church before.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
This was on the occasion of the dedication of a church
at Meerut, India, where in a remote situation, in sight of
the Himalaya Mountains, he found an excellent organ in
what he described as &ldquo;one of the earliest, the largest
and handsomest churches in India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind singers of London chose well when they decided
to sing the hymn of this consecrated man.</p>
<h3 id="c67">Not Too Late to Hear the Christmas Music</h3>
<p>Newspapers all over the United States on Christmas
Day, 1945, carried pictures of returning troops from the
scenes of war, as they arrived in the harbor of Los Angeles.
The men were shown crowding the rails of the boats,
and on their faces there was a wistful look. Happiness
and disappointment were both registered. While they
were privileged to see their native land on another Christmas
Day, after their long and hard experiences in conflict,
yet they were too late to join the Christmas circles in
their homes.</p>
<p>A group of singers, however, made the rounds of the
various ships on a greeter boat, and welcomed the warrior
lads by the singing of Christmas carols. Sweet was it to
the men to hear the singers render the old carol:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,</p>
<p class="t0">O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!</p>
<p class="t0">Come and behold Him, born the King of angels!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When the chorus was reached many of the men on
shipboard also sang or hummed the lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him</p>
<p class="t0">O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The origin of this great Christian hymn is obscure. This
observation is made by Dr. Charles A. Boyd: &ldquo;Here is
another of the much loved hymns of the church which
we owe to the old Latin hymn-writers. They wrote not for
money or fame, but for the love of the writing, and for
the praise of Christ.&rdquo; A somewhat extended discussion of
both hymn and tune is found in the work of Dr. James
Moffatt, and at the close he says: &ldquo;The conclusion seems
to be that the hymn and tune came into use together, in
the services of the Roman Church, during the first part of
the eighteenth century; that they were in circulation in
manuscript for some time before they appeared in print,
but that nothing definite can as yet be stated as to the
author of either words or music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a young high school student, whom I knew, attended
the illumination of a community Christmas tree
she heard a chorus of Welsh voices, at midnight on Christmas
Eve, sing this carol. Several times before, very naturally,
she had heard it in church and school. But this
night she returned home full of enthusiasm, and said to
her parents, &ldquo;I never before heard anything so beautiful!&rdquo;
Perhaps the returning troops had just this feeling when
they listened to this and other carols rendered in the
Christmas season of 1945, as they were welcomed back
with joyful song to the land for which they had victoriously
fought.</p>
<h3 id="c68">Carol the Children Wanted</h3>
<p>Two little girls jumped from their bed to listen to the
choir of an English church as they were making their
rounds at Christmastide singing carols, according to a
local custom. They were, of course, singing the old favorites,
as they had been doing for a few successive evenings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
and they were tired. But this was their last call for
the year.</p>
<p>The first selection was rendered when, according to the
one who narrated the incident in an English periodical
(Mrs. Lyndon Hill), a bedroom window was lifted, and
two little girls leaned out and asked them to sing the
carol they most loved, &ldquo;Away in a Manger.&rdquo; Soon the
Christmas callers were singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,</p>
<p class="t0">The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.</p>
<p class="t0">The stars in the sky looked down where He lay,</p>
<p class="t0">The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;In all our singing it had never occurred to us to sing
this seemingly childish carol,&rdquo; said the one who related
the story; &ldquo;but we did sing it, and the beauty and simplicity
of the words and tune struck me as never before,
as the two little voices joined with us. They seemed
to be the expression of all the wonder of God&rsquo;s gift of
the Christ child in the humility of His manger bed, and
our singing took on new life as we caught a vision of
the utter simplicity of the Christmas message.... And
I never fail to receive inspiration from the mental picture
of two little sleepy girls at a bedroom window singing
&lsquo;Away in a Manger.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what an especially appropriate prayer it must have
been for the little girls when they closed the song with
the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay,</p>
<p class="t0">Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.</p>
<p class="t0">Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,</p>
<p class="t0">And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CROSS AND THE CHURCH</span></h2>
<p>A large group of Christian men gathered in Chicago
early in 1938 for a convention. Said one who was present:
&ldquo;The mood and point of view were indicated by the
opening hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ask ye what great thing I know</p>
<p class="t0">That delights and stirs me so?</p>
<p class="t0">What the high regard I win?</p>
<p class="t0">Whose the name I glory in?</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus Christ, the crucified.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The great and inspiring gathering closed with the same
hymn, and thus before they separated these same men
sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;This is that great thing I know;</p>
<p class="t0">This delights and stirs me so:</p>
<p class="t0">Faith in Him who died to save,</p>
<p class="t0">Him who triumphed o&rsquo;er the grave,</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus Christ the crucified.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;But His lone cross and crown of thorns</p>
<p class="t">Endure when crowns and empires fall.</p>
<p class="t0">The might of His undying love</p>
<p class="t">In dying conquered all.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c70">Building Gone, but Hymn Remains</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Above the hills of time the cross is gleaming,</p>
<p class="t">Fair as the sun when night has turned to day;</p>
<p class="t0">And from it love&rsquo;s pure light is richly streaming,</p>
<p class="t">To cleanse the heart and banish sin away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The church where that hymn was first sung is utterly
destroyed, but the hymn remains. In this thought I take
comfort.&rdquo; Thus wrote the Rev. Thomas Tiplady, superintendent
of the Lambeth Mission, London, to The Hymn
Society of America a few weeks after the end of World
War II. He explained thus: &ldquo;Had not the Church of
England friends granted the use of a tiny chapel and a
wooden hut the congregation would have been entirely
homeless, for the wrecking of the entire buildings of the
Mission was completed by a rocket bomb.&rdquo; The building
was historic, and dated back to the ministry of the notable
commentator, Dr. Adam Clark.</p>
<p>The author has written a fairly large collection of
hymns, and they are rapidly finding places in new hymnals.
But &ldquo;Above the Hills of Time&rdquo; continues to be the favorite.
Congregations sing with enthusiasm:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To this dear cross the eyes of men are turning</p>
<p class="t">Today as in the ages lost to sight;</p>
<p class="t0">And so for Thee, O Christ, men&rsquo;s hearts are yearning</p>
<p class="t">As shipwrecked seamen yearn for morning light.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Visits to the United States have been made by the
author; and the writer was privileged to hear him speak
at Columbus, Ohio, to an immense audience. Hearers were
profoundly moved as this chaplain in World War I told
the story which is found in his book, &ldquo;The Cross at the
Front.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>This beautiful tribute appeared in a review of one of
his little collections of hymns, where an English periodical
made this comment: &ldquo;Hymns are rarely poetry, say the
critics, but there is poetry of a high order here ... and
frequent evidence that the poet has been inspired not by
the muse alone, but also by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; No one
doubts this when he hears a great congregation sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Like echoes to sweet temple bells replying,</p>
<p class="t">Our hearts, O Lord, make answer to Thy love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c71">An Army with Banners</h3>
<p>A monster rally of the Salvation Army for the raising
of needed funds was held in New York City in March,
1938, when something dramatic occurred which brought
the vast audience to its feet. Among the speakers were
many noted people, including Walter Lippmann, the renowned
philosopher, and General Hugh S. Johnson, experienced
soldier and distinguished writer.</p>
<p>The speakers had been talking about the need of peace.
Then, at one point, the Salvation Army officer in charge,
asked: &ldquo;Is there no solution for the world&rsquo;s woes but
bayonets in the hands of soldiers?&rdquo; He paused. Quickly
the answer came as the band began to play:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Church&rsquo;s one foundation</p>
<p class="t">Is Jesus Christ her Lord;</p>
<p class="t0">She is His new creation</p>
<p class="t">By water and the word;</p>
<p class="t0">From heaven He came and sought her</p>
<p class="t">To be His holy bride;</p>
<p class="t0">With His own blood He bought her,</p>
<p class="t">And for her life He died.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid toil and tribulation,</p>
<p class="t">And tumult of her war,</p>
<p class="t0">She waits the consummation</p>
<p class="t">Of peace for evermore;</p>
<p class="t0">Till, with the vision glorious,</p>
<p class="t">Her longing eyes are blest,</p>
<p class="t0">And the great Church victorious</p>
<p class="t">Shall be the Church at rest.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Emphasis was given to the song when a group of
&ldquo;eager and exalted&rdquo; young soldiers of the Salvation
Army marched into the building carrying their own colors
and the national emblem. These youthful soldiers, enlisted
in the cause of Christ, were militantly engaged in service
for the Prince of Peace. And the parade of the singing
soldiers &ldquo;touched everybody deeply.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c72">Church Cross Inspired Grocer&rsquo;s Song</h3>
<p>A church which he served in his early ministry is thus
described by Dr. William L. Stidger, professor in Boston
University: &ldquo;There was a little church on the top of a
hill in the sand dunes of the Sunset District of San Francisco,
California. On the top of that beautiful little church,
covered with ivy vines, a white revolving cross flashed
its light through the night across the dunes.&rdquo; I visited that
church when I attended the great Exposition in the city
mentioned, and heard Dr. Stidger preach. In fact, I received
great kindness at his hands during the few days
I was in the city. Through him I was privileged to attend
a meeting at which Edwin Markham spoke.</p>
<p>In one of his articles Professor Stidger related this
story: &ldquo;At the foot of that little hill there was a grocery
store. The light of that revolving cross, when it turned
west, flashed through the front windows of that grocery
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
store. The proprietor of the store, Robert Mobbs, as he
waited on his customers at evening time, could look up
and see the flash of that white cross and it always gave
him a comfortable feeling. He liked that cross, he liked
to have it flash its message into his store when the twilight
fell across the sand dunes looking toward the Golden
Gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert Mobbs, tall, angular, had been born in Prince
Edward Island, and he had grown up in a church-going
family. His mother had taught him to memorize the great
hymns of the church and he loved them. As he worked
in the grocery store he liked to hum the hymns of the
church over to himself as he waited on his customers.
The hymn he loved best of all was &lsquo;In the Cross of Christ
I Glory.&rsquo; He would hum that hymn to himself as the
evening shadows gathered and the light of Calvary&rsquo;s
Cross flashed in through the wide windows. One of his
customers, hearing him, said, &lsquo;I go out with little songs
singing in my heart. I like it.&rsquo;&rdquo; He had heard the grocer
sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In the cross of Christ I glory,</p>
<p class="t">Towering o&rsquo;er the wrecks of time;</p>
<p class="t0">All the light of sacred story</p>
<p class="t">Gather round its head sublime.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c73">Visiting Singer Familiar with the Hymn</h3>
<p>Nelson Eddy, famed for his singing voice, was far from
his American home when he gave a concert to the United
States Army on a Saturday evening at Aden. But an interesting
sidelight of this visit to the troops was given
in <i>The British Weekly</i> in February, 1944, and also referred
to the next morning, when he sang in the little
Scots Kirk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The explanation was made to the soloist to the effect
that the place of worship was only a small building. But,
accepting the invitation, he said that the size of the church
made no difference, as it was his personal wish to sing
the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in the Scottish Church. He, therefore,
slipped quietly into the building just as the congregation
had begun to sing the hymn, &ldquo;Crown Him With Many
Crowns.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not only did he join in,&rdquo; said the one who
reported the incident, &ldquo;but he practically led the singing,
and without a hymn book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the scripture lesson, Mr. Eddy rendered his solo,
a musical setting of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, &ldquo;And it was magnificently
sung as if it were a prayer.&rdquo; The soloist remained
while another hymn was sung, and then he quietly
left the sanctuary, as he had to leave Aden immediately.</p>
<p>It was interesting to learn that the visiting singer was
so familiar with the hymn, &ldquo;Crown Him With Many
Crowns,&rdquo; and that he sang it so heartily. It is one of
stirring hymns of the Christian Church, and with the
tune to which it is set, &ldquo;Diademata,&rdquo; it makes a jubilant
song of praise. Hymn and tune form &ldquo;a perfect union.&rdquo;
Said Covert and Laufer: &ldquo;The tune fully conveys the
triumphant and ecstatic joy of the text, and yet its great
dignity and solidity are preserved. It is a tune which organists
like to play and which choirs and congregations
enjoy singing.&rdquo; Even in wartime, doubtless, all enjoyed
singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Crown Him the Lord of peace,</p>
<p class="t">Whose power a scepter sways</p>
<p class="t0">From pole to pole, that wars may cease,</p>
<p class="t">And all be prayer and praise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A portion of Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, is indicated

for silence and said, &ldquo;I have just learned of the passing of a
great soul and I&rsquo;m going to sing something for a memorial to
him.&rdquo; And then he sang &ldquo;I Am Goin&rsquo; Home&rdquo; with a theme
from the &ldquo;New World Symphony,&rdquo; in an arrangement by William

<h3 id="c75">Easter Song of a Centenarian</h3>
<p>Living in two centuries and in two countries, the Rev.
Timothy Edwards enjoyed some unusual experiences. He
loved both to preach and to sing. Born in England, he
reached the United States before 1870, and was assigned
to a circuit in Michigan, as a minister of the Methodist
Episcopal Church. But because of throat trouble, he was
compelled to leave his ministerial work in 1876.</p>
<p>He then became editor of a small paper, and likewise a
student of law. Later he was admitted to the bar. After
a few years, however, he was able to re-enter the ministry,
and served churches in northern Michigan until, in 1895,
he was superannuated.</p>
<p>When he observed his ninetieth birthday, he preached
in the Methodist Church at Washington, Michigan, and
said: &ldquo;I will not speak in this church again until I am
one hundred years old&rdquo;&mdash;and he did not. But on April 1,
1934, celebrating his 100th birthday he once more
preached in the same church.</p>
<p>Midway in the sermon his congregation was delighted
when the aged Christian, one of God&rsquo;s singing saints,
voiced his experience in sacred song. It was one he long
had loved:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine,</p>
<p class="t">For Thee all the follies of sin I resign;</p>
<p class="t0">My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou,</p>
<p class="t">If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, &rsquo;tis now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was Easter Sunday, and the centenarian could look
forward to an ageless life beyond the present. Hence he
could sing:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In mansions of glory and endless delight,</p>
<p class="t">I&rsquo;ll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,</p>
<p class="t">If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, &rsquo;tis now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The veteran preacher made that Easter Sunday memorable
to his congregation, and led them to see how happy
a Christian can be when he reaches the age of one hundred.</p>
<h3 id="c76">Easter in New Guinea</h3>
<p>Sunrise in New Guinea in 1943 made Easter morning
memorable for Lt. John McDaniel Slocum, whose home
was in Oswego, Oregon. Earlier he had dropped out of
the freshman class at Oregon State College to enlist in
the service of his country. By Easter, 1943, he was a
second lieutenant in the infantry, and was in charge of
a reconnaissance party of twelve men in New Guinea.
These men had been away from their base for many
weeks, and were living on powdered milk and canned
stew. The letter which he wrote to his mother at Eastertide
was a significant one. Said he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my men and myself were having a big gabfest last
night, and the fact that Easter was today was mentioned.
Not too much was said and the subject was dropped....
But for some reason I woke up at 5:30 and I just had
an impulse to go out to our hill which overlooks the
ocean, and hold myself a little sunrise service.... Every
man in camp was there!... We sang several hymns.
Some natives (Christians) joined us, and we sang some
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the sky turned pink we all were quiet. As the sun
came up someone started to sing &lsquo;The Star-Spangled Banner,&rsquo;
and as the sun rose over the mighty blue Pacific our
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
voices, with a background of natives humming, reached
out across that sea to tell all of you at home that all
was well....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one of the boys took out a Bible and asked me
to read something from it.... As I glanced at the
opened page there was the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. I read it through
very quietly once, and then we all said it in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, with a glance at the rising sun, we all returned
to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What an unforgettable Easter for those young Americans!
Fighting for their native land on far-distant shores,
yet &ldquo;at the dawn&rsquo;s early light&rdquo; on Easter morning they
could sing their song of patriotic hope:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c77">Eastertide Hymn at an Easter Funeral</h3>
<p>They sang, they all sang, at the funeral of Mrs. Grace
Beaven in Rochester, N. Y., on Easter Monday, in 1938.
She would have liked that, for she was a lover of music.
In her girlhood days she journeyed from her far-away
home in Tacoma, Washington, to New York City that
she might pursue a course in music. Completing her
course, she returned to her home community, and became
choir director in the First Baptist Church. Soon she became
the bride of a young Baptist minister, served with him
in the pastorate, and then shared his responsible life when
he, the Rev. Dr. Albert W. Beaven, became the president
of the Colgate-Rochester Divinity School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lived radiantly and gallantly to the end,&rdquo; testified
her husband, who confessed that he had asked for himself
the privilege of conducting her funeral service. Clear and
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
strong was his voice as, entering the Lake Avenue Baptist,
Rochester, he read the great words of affirmation from
the Scripture, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; The
standing congregation then sang the triumphant Easter
song of Charles Wesley:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Christ the Lord is risen today,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The bereaved family sang with the congregation. The
song on the lips came from their hearts, whatever tears
may have been in their eyes. A thousand voices united
with theirs in singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Soar we now where Christ has led,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t0">Following our exalted Head,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t0">Made like Him, like Him we rise,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t0">Ours the cross, the grave, the skies,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;This hymn by Charles Wesley ... has long been
accepted as the best English Easter Hymn&rdquo; was the positive
statement made by W. T. Stead. Unquestionably it is
also sung more frequently than any other selection in our
American churches on Easter Sunday. The author once
went through the published Easter Sunday morning programs
of twenty-nine churches of various denominations
of a city near his home at that time. This hymn appeared
in all but three of the programs, and mostly it was the
opening selection. Poetic language asks the question:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s thy victory, boasting grave?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Then it gives the assuring reply:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s redeeming work is done</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t0">Fought the fight, the battle won,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Friday, July 23, 1742, John Wesley was with his beloved
mother. &ldquo;Her look was calm and serene,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and her eyes fixed upward, while we commended her
soul to God. Soon the soul was set at liberty. There was
no struggle. Those present then stood round the bed, and
fulfilled her last request, uttered a little while before she
lost her speech, &lsquo;Children, as soon as I am released, sing
a psalm of praise to God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passion-tide and an Easter message is summed up in
the undying words of one of the singing sons of that
honored mother which the family and friends of Grace
Beaven sang on that Easter Monday soon after, being
released from suffering, she joined the great multitude of
the singing company in the celestial city.</p>
<p>What other hymn has such a triumphant climax?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Made like Him, like Him we rise,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t0">Ours the cross, the grave, the skies,</p>
<p class="t">Alleluia!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c78">Mother&rsquo;s Hymn at Eventide</h3>
<p>A little girl would clutch her mother&rsquo;s hand and the
two would go through the tall grass of an English
meadow to a stile. There they both loved to stand to
watch the sunset. Just when the last crimson streak was
dying in the west, the mother would sing, in her rich
Welsh voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Forever with the Lord!</p>
<p class="t">Amen, so let it be;</p>
<p class="t0">Life from the dead is in that word,</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis immortality.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The manner in which the woman greeted the passing
of the day left a memory with the young daughter which
the latter carried with her through the years, and brought
with her when she came to America. &ldquo;Sing, kitten,&rdquo; the
mother would sometimes exclaim. Then, with faces still
set westward, the daughter would chirp with her little
voice, and the two would sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here in the body pent,</p>
<p class="t">Absent from Him I roam,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet nightly pitch my moving tent</p>
<p class="t">A day&rsquo;s march nearer home.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="t">Jerusalem above;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>but she carried with her the memory of being led into a
room where she saw her father kneeling by the bed, with
his face hidden in his hands. The clergyman was there
administering Holy Communion; also present was the
family physician. An older sister was sobbing.</p>
<p>Rushing to the bedside, the child gazed at the bright,
beloved face of her mother. She was smiling. Her lips
began to move. Beatrice Plumb, who once told this story
about her mother and herself, said that even before she
put her ear close to her mother, she knew that the latter
was singing their eventide hymn.</p>
<p>Opening her eyes, the mother faintly whispered, &ldquo;Sing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
Kitten!&rdquo; Once more, the last time together, mother and
little daughter were singing their old sunset song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Forever with the Lord!</p>
<p class="t">Amen so let it be;</p>
<p class="t0">Life from the dead is in that word,</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis immortality.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Carved on the mother&rsquo;s tombstone, and cherished in
the daughter&rsquo;s memory, were the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Forever with the Lord!&rdquo;</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
